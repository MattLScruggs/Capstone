Yeasts of genus Candida are associated with a wide range of differ- ent clinical manifestations, including bloodstream infec- tions (BSIs), intra-abdominal candidiasis, deep-seated candidiasis, and superficial infections [1, 4, 5]. Infections caused by Candida spp. have progressively increased over the last decades, and this phenomenon is mainly associ- ated with the increasing rate of invasive procedures, the extensive use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and the more frequent immunocompromised status of critically ill patients [6–8]. Although Candida albicans still remains the main agent of hospital-acquired fungal infection, sev- eral species of non-albicans Candida namely C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. krusei account for in- creasing incidence of invasive infections with high rates of   * Correspondence: andrea.cortegiani@unipa.it 1  Department of Surgical, Oncological and Oral Science (Di.Chir.On.S.).

Candida auris is an emerging multi-drug-resistant fungus that is rapidly spreading worldwide. Since the first reports in 2009, many isolates across five continents have been identified as agents of hospital-associated infections. Independent and simultaneous outbreaks of C. auris are becoming a major concern for healthcare and scientific community. Moreover, laboratory misidentification and multi-drug-resistant profiles, rarely observed for other non-albicans Candida species, result in difficult eradication and frequent therapeutic failures of C. auris infections. The aim of this review was to provide an updated and comprehensive report of the global spread of C. auris, focusing on clinical and microbiological characteristics, mechanisms of virulence and antifungal resistance, and efficacy of available control, preventive, and therapeutic strategies. Keywords: C. auris, Candida, Candidemia, Invasive fungal infection, Antimicrobial resistance, Antifungal resistanceNA therapeutic failure, mainly related to echinocandins and azoles resistance [9–11]. Current increase in antifungal drug resistance is not only linked to the acquired mech- anism following administration of antifungal agents but intrinsic resistance to several classes of antimicrobials among different non-albicans species has also been re- corded [12]. C. auris is an emerging multi-drug-resistant fungus that is rapidly spreading worldwide. Since the first re- ports in 2009, many isolates have been identified across five continents as agents of hospital-associated infections [11, 13, 14]. Reported cases are characterized by high overall mortality [15, 16] and high rate of antifungal re- sistance [17]. Of note, most reported infections involved critically ill patients [15, 18]. Moreover, difficulty in microbiological identification [19, 20], high virulence [21–23], multi-drug resistance profile [24, 25], and rapid global spread with several reported outbreaks ([11, 26, 27];NAtracking-c-auris.html); [28]) lead the healthcare and sci- entific communities to consider C. auris as one of the most serious emerging pathogen that critical care physi-NA cians should be aware of.© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Main text Systematic review For the purpose of this review, we performed a system- atic review of the literature using “Candida” AND “auris” as keywords. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We excluded articles in languages other than English. Two authors (A. C. and G. M.) independ- ently performed the search. Differences in selections were solved by consensus, with the help of the third author (T. F.). We included peer-review articles and meeting abstracts, concerning epidemiology, clinical manifestations and risk factors, virulence, genotypic characteristics, and therapeutic management. Concern- ing clinical cases, we included all cases of isolation of C. auris in humans reported in literature. Cases were de- fined as patients in whom C. auris was isolated, and this definition includes both superficial and deep-seated in- fections. We also checked references of relevant articles to find potential articles not retrieved by the databases search. After excluding not relevant articles and dupli- cates, we included 131 relevant articles published from 2009 to 30 May 2018. Articles retrieved were further cat- egorized as shown in the flow diagram, following PRISMA guidelines (Additional file 1).  Microbiological characteristics of C. auris On Sabouraud’s agar, C. auris produces smooth and white cream-colored colonies, which are germ tube test negative. On CHROMagar Candida medium, C. auris produces colonies that may appear pale to dark pink, or rarely beige. The yeast C. auris is able to grow at 42 °C, and this characteristic helps differentiate C. auris from C. haemulonii, which does not grow at these tempera- tures [19]. The microscopic morphology of C. auris cells appears to be oval without pseudohyphae formation. However, C. auris might exhibit multiple morphological phenotypes under different cultures conditions, includ- ing round-to-ovoid, elongated, and pseudohyphal-like forms. For instance, high concentrations of sodium chloride induce the formation of a pseudohyphal-like form [29]. Cycloheximide 0.1% and 0.01% inhibits its growth [30]. The phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic characteristics (Fig. 1) have therefore clearly suggested that it was a new species affiliated to the genus Candida (anamorphic) and therefore to the class of Ascomycetes even if the perfect form is not known (teleomorphic). Whole genome phylogeny of C. auris, C. haemulonii, C. duobushaemulonii, and C.  (2018) 6:69NANA The aim of this review is to provide an updated report clade, confirming the close relationship of these species [31]. Due to the close genetic relatedness with C. hae- mulonii complex, C. auris is often commonly misidenti- fied as C. haemulonii in routine diagnostic laboratories using biochemical methods. In fact, commercially avail- able biochemical-based tests, including API AUX 20C, VITEK-2 YST, BD Phoenix, and MicroScan, misidentify C. auris as a wide range of Candida species and other genera. Misidentifications yielding C. famata, C. sake, Rhodotorula glutinis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Saccha- romyces, C. catenulate, C. lusitaniae, C. guilliermondii, and C. parapsilosis have been reported [19, 20, 26]. Re- cently, BioMerieux has updated the database [32, 33] and inclusion of C. auris spectra in the VITEK-2 system yields to its correct identification. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry can reliably differentiate C. auris from other Candida species, provided C. auris spectrum is in- cluded in the reference database and by selecting appro- priate extraction method [34, 35]. The development of specific PCR assays for C. auris and for C. auris-related species using cultured colonies seems promising for its rapid and accurate identification, particularly in outbreak settings [36, 37]. Molecular identification of C. auris can be performed by sequencing various genetic loci (includ- ing D1/D2, RPB1, RPB2, and internal transcribed spacer ITS1, ITS2), but it is not routinely used [38, 39].Epidemiology trends and world outbreaks The real prevalence and the epidemiology of C. auris still remain uncertain. One of the causes may be the underestimation of its isolation due to the limited accur- acy of available conventional diagnostic tools [40]. With the purpose to investigate whether C. auris emerged in recent times or had been misidentified in the past, an extensive investigation was conducted within the pool of uncommon Candida spp. included in the SENTRY glo- bal fungal collection (15,271 isolates of Candida spp. from four continents) [41]. This study identified a single C. auris isolate from Pakistan dating back to 2008, which had not been previously recognized [41]. In 2011, Lee et al. reported the first three cases of bloodstream funge- mia caused by C. auris highlighting antifungal resistance and the ability to cause invasive infections [42]. One of these cases was incidentally recognized by molecular identification of a microbiological sample obtained in 1996 as invasive fungal infection isolate. To our know- ledge, there are no other unidentified C. auris strains prior to 1996. The first “named” description of C. auris as a new emergent pathogen has been reported in 2009 by Satoh et al. [13]. The authors reported a single isolate from the discharge of the external ear canal of a 70-year-oldCortegiani et al.

Phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and phylogenetic analyses indicated an affiliation to Candida genus, with a close relation to other unusual species [13] such as C. haemulonii and C. pseudohaemulonii. Later, in South Korea [14], 15 patients affected by chronic oti- tis media were identified to be infected by unusual and clonally related yeast isolates of C. auris confirmed by genomic sequencing [43]. Since the first isolation, C. auris infections have been reported from many coun- tries, including India [15, 24, 38, 44], Pakistan [41], South Korea [42], Malaysia [45], South Africa [46], Oman [47, 48], Kenya [49], Kuwait [50], Israel [51], United Arab Emirates [52], Saudi Arabia [53], China [54], Colombia [55–57], Venezuela [58], the United States (US) ((https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/can- didiasis/tracking-c-auris.html); [59–61]), Russia [62], Canada [63], Panama [64, 65], the United Kingdom (UK) [66], and continental Europe [28, 67–70]. Figure 2 shows C. auris reported isolations in chronological order. Figure 3 shows the worldwide distribution.  increasing, although the epidemiological profile is not completely defined [28]. Recently, the ECDC published a  (2018) 6:69NANANANA survey on reported cases of C. auris and laboratory cap- acity in Europe, with the purpose to implement surveil- lance and to control its further spread [28]. Six hundred and twenty cases of C. auris were reported in a period from 2013 to 2017, with two countries experiencing four hospital outbreaks. Sporadic cases have been identified since 2013 from different patients throughout England. The first outbreak of C. auris in Europe occurred in a London cardio-thoracic center between April 2015 and July 2016; 50 cases were identified, with ability for rapid colonization and transmissibility within the healthcare setting, leading to a serious and prolonged outbreak [66]. The first C. auris invasive infection in continental Europe occurred in Spain, where four patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit of Valencia La Fe University and Polytechnic Hospital (Valencia, Spain) between April and June 2016 were diagnosed with deep-seated infection caused by this “super-fungus” [67]. Despite efforts in limiting diffusion of this pathogen, new colonization cases have continued to appear until now, with a tendency to acquire an endemic pattern. Europe’s burden of C. auris outbreaks appears to be 2017, 140 patients were colonized by C. auris and 41 pa- tients underwent candidemia episodes, with 5 patientsCortegiani et al.

Since then, there has been a progressive increase in the number of clinical cases reported. The high prevalence of invasive infec- tions due to C. auris has become a great concern in India, as inter- and intra-hospital spreading of this multi-resistant pathogen has been demonstrated [15]. Public Indian institutions are characterized by higher      Fig. 3 Worldwide distribution of C. auris reported cases  (2018) 6:69NANANANA prevalence of C. auris isolation than private hospitals, possibly connected to overcrowding and compromised infection control measures [15], with C. auris prevalence ranging from 5 to 30% of all candidemia cases in certain Chowdhary et al. in 2013 were the first to report an to be the second most prevalent species causing candi- demia in a tertiary care trauma center in Delhi, India, warranting more effective infection control practices to prevent its spread [43]. Moreover, outbreaks of candide- mia in Pakistan could be related to the interregional spread of the pathogen, as demonstrated by genomic se- quencing of Indian and Pakistani isolates [41]. In US, the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a clinical alert in June 2016 informingNANANA Cortegiani et al. Journal of Intensive Care     clinicians, laboratories, infection control practitioners, and public health authorities about C. auris. It requested that all cases be adequately reported to authorities and to the CDC [71, 72]. This report describes the first seven US cases of C. auris infection occurring during May 2013 and August 2016. Six of seven cases were identified through retrospective review of microbiology records from reporting hospitals and reference laboratories [60]. As of May 2018, CDC recorded 311 confirmed and 29 probable cases of C. auris infection. Most C. auris iso- lates in the US have been detected in the New York City area and New Jersey (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/disease s/candidiasis/tracking-c-auris.html). Available epidemio- logical information suggests that most strains of C. auris isolated in the United States were introduced from abroad. Isolates from Illinois and New York were of the same clade as those from South America and South Asia respectively [61]. However, it is not possible to exclude that most of these cases were acquired in the US follow- ing local transmission in healthcare settings [60].  in US healthcare outbreaks, one of the major questions regarding C. auris spread is whether it emerged inde- pendently in different countries or if a single outbreak spread from an original source [40]. Using WGS (whole genome sequencing) and SNP (single-nucleotide poly- morphism) analysis together with epidemiological obser- vation [25, 41], it was possible to demonstrate an independent and simultaneous emergence of different C. auris clonal populations on different geographical areas. Specifically, it was possible to identify the emergence of four different clades (East and South Asian, African, South American) in as many different regions. Transmission within the healthcare setting is suggested by the clonal re- latedness of isolates in different institutions [24, 38, 40, 67].  America. The first outbreak was reported in Venezuela between March 2012 and July 2013 [58]. All the isolates were initially identified as C. haemulonii. However, isola- tion of C. auris was later confirmed by genome sequen- cing. The Venezuelan outbreak resulted in C. auris being the sixth most common cause of candidemia in the in- volved institution. In Colombia, sporadic cases have been reported since 2012 [55–57]. Interestingly, an out- break was reported in a pediatric intensive care unit in 2016, where five cases of invasive infections were identi- fied. Shortly after, nine cases have been isolated in Panama, where patterns of resistance detected by both microdilution method were similar to those observed among C. auris isolates in Colombia [65].  outbreaks were in South Africa and Kenya. The first four South African cases were isolated in 2012–2013 [46]. Other 10 isolates have been detected, demonstrating a  (2018) 6:69NANA close relation but phylogenetically distinct from Pakistan, India, and Venezuela [41]. Instead, according to other studies, isolates from South Africa had se- quence similarity with those from UK [73]. C. auris has been considered as the most common pathogen respon- sible for candidemias in a reference hospital in Kenya, accounting for 45 (38%) episodes over a nearly 3-year period [49]. Only a single report of C. auris candidaemia has been published to date in Israel [17]. Collected strains were phylogenetically different from those from East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, indicating an independent emergence of the pathogen. Infections have been reported in different Gulf States, including Kuwait [50], Oman [47, 48], and United Arab Emirates [52]. Recently, the first three cases in Saudi Arabia have been reported [53].Clinical characteristics, risk factors, and outcome In most cases, clinical presentation is non-specific and it is often difficult to differentiate between other types of Although imported cases have been demonstrated as last 5 years were isolated from blood and other deep-seated sites of infection (including invasive devices and catheters tips) [16]. Different clinical conditions in- cluding bloodstream infections, urinary tract infection, otitis, surgical wound infections, skin abscesses (related to insertion of the catheter), myocarditis, meningitis, bone infections, and wound infections have been related to C. auris [15, 18]. However, isolations from non-sterile body sites such as lungs, urinary tract, skin and soft tis- sue, and genital apparatus may more likely represent colonization rather than infections [18, 74]. As for other Candida spp., the presence of signs and symptoms of in- fections of the site where C. auris has been isolated from can help to differentiate between simple colonization Different reports have been published from South from a non-sterile body site because colonization poses the risk of transmission, which requires implementation of infection control precautions [71, 72]. To investigate risk factors associated to C. auris infec- tions, Rudramurthy et al. conducted a subgroup analysis and comparison of the clinical manifestations of C. auris and non-auris cases in 27 Indian ICUs [15]. In accord- ance with previous studies, risk factors were not differ- ent from those associated with invasive infection due to other Candida spp. [22], including prior or continuous exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents, diabetes mellitus, abdominal and vascular sur- gery, presence of central venous catheters, urinary catheterization, post-operative drain placement, chronic In Africa, the first identification of sporadic cases and hemodialysis, total parenteral nutrition, immunosup- pressive state [75] and neutropenia [45], and length of ICU stay [15, 18, 76]. The incidence of C. auris isCortegiani et al. Journal of Intensive Care     significantly higher in patients with primary or acquired altered immune response, secondary to therapeutic man- agement of hematologic malignancies, bone marrow transplantation, and other condition requiring immuno- suppressive agents [60]. Interestingly, Azar et al. reported the first case of donor-derived transmission of C. auris in a lung transplant patient [75], highlighting several implica- tions on microbiological surveillance before transplants.  demia is estimated to range from 30 to 72% [16, 26, 41, 44, 69]. Available data suggest that the vast majority of infections affects adults, with a propensity for critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Pediatric patients have only been reported in Asia and South America [77]. A better outcome was seen in this popula- tion [42, 58, 77].  Infection prevention and control The progressive increase of outbreaks and sporadic cases of C. auris infection emphasize the need for adequate prevention measures. According to reports of recent outbreaks, colonization is difficult to eradicate and it  Table 1 Key points for C. auris prevention and control by the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control (ECDC) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ECDC Correct identification (MALDI-TOF; DNA sequencing of the D1/D2 domain); Clinicians and microbiologists alertness; Notification and retrospective case-finding Good standard infection control measures (including environmental cleaning, reprocessing of medical devices and patient isolation) and prompt notification      Early identification of carriers by using active surveillance cultures (sites considered for sampling include nose/throat, axilla, groin, rectum, insertion sites of venous catheters; clinical samples such as urine, feces, wound drain fluid, and respiratory specimens)      Establish the source of the outbreak (epidemiological investigation, cross-sectional patient screening and environmental sampling); prevention of inter-hospital and cross-border transmission  Enhanced control measures to contain outbreaks (such as contact precautions, single room isolation or patient cohorting, and dedicated nursing staff for colonized or infected patients) Education and practice audits (for healthcare workers and contacts)    Antifungal stewardship  (2018) 6:69NANA tends to persist for months [66, 69]. Prevention of out- breaks has to be based on the early recognition of spora- dical cases, identification of reservoirs and prompt notification. Guidance has been released by international organizations such as Public Health England (PHE-UK) [78], the CDC [79], the ECDC [70], and the Center for Opportunistic Tropical and Hospital Infections (COTHI-South Africa) [80], with recommendations re- The crude in-hospital mortality rate for C. auris candi- and cleaning of equipment and environments in contact with affected patients. Prevention and infection control policies are empirical and mainly based on indications formulated for containment strategies for other multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Table 1 summarizes rec- ommendations by the CDC and the ECDC for preven- tion and control of C. auris transmission. Although the exact mode of transmission has to be identified, early evidence suggests that C. auris spread is mainly related to exposure to contaminated facilities and transmission from healthcare personnel. Persistent out- breaks have been associated with hand transmission and contamination of surfaces [61, 66, 81, 82]. However, theNACDC Correct identification (MALDI-TOF; molecular methods) Confirmed isolates of C. auris should be reported to local and state public health officials and to CDCInfection control measures: • Placing the patient with C. auris in a single-patient room and using contact precautions • Emphasizing adherence to hand hygiene • Cleaning and disinfecting the patient care environment (daily and terminal cleaning) with recommended products • Screening contacts of newly identified case patients to identify C. auris colonization Screening should be performed to identify colonization among potentially epidemiologically linked patients, including: • Current roommates • Roommates at the current or other facilities in the prior month (even if they have been discharged from the facility) Screening for C. auris should be done using a composite swab of the patient’s axilla and groin (sites of consistent colonization). Patients have also been found to be colonized with C. auris in nose, external ear canals, oropharynx, urine, wounds, and rectum. All laboratories, especially laboratories serving healthcare facilities where cases of C. auris have been detected, should: • Review past microbiology records to identify cases of confirmed or suspected C. auris • Conduct prospective surveillance to identify C. auris cases in the future • Consider screening close contacts of patients with C. auris for presence of colonization Education of all healthcare personnel, including staff working with environmental cleaning services about C. auris and need for appropriate precautions; Monitor adherence to infection control practices Antibiotic and antifungal stewardshipCortegiani et al. Journal of Intensive Care     role of healthcare workers still remains difficult to deter- mine. A recent study sampled patients and their con- tacts, healthcare workers, and environment in four  hospitals in Colombia that had previously reported C. auris outbreaks, and found C. auris on different objects and facilities, such as bedrails, a bed hand-controller, a mobile phone, and floors. Interestingly, positive samples were collected from surfaces with infrequent patient  contact but frequent healthcare workers contact (i.e., chairs, bed trays, and medical equipment), and from sur- faces with little to no patient contact and infrequent  healthcare workers contact (i.e., closet cabinets, door  handles, alcohol gel dispensers) [83]. Thus, once C. auris is introduced in the hospital setting, environmental con- tamination evolves well beyond the patient bedside, resulting in recurrent cases of new colonizations.  moist surfaces, including plastic where the pathogen may reside for up to 14 days [84]. C. auris seems to be resistant to quaternary compounds disinfectants and cat- ionic surface-active products. Disinfectants with spori- cidal activity and hydrogen peroxide-based products are indicated to clean surfaces and healthcare facilities, resulting in highest reduction of C. auris colony-forming unit (CFU) [81, 85, 86]. Chlorine-based detergents, ultra- violet light, and hydrogen peroxide vapor demonstrated their efficacy in environmental decontamination proce- dures after patient discharge [61, 66, 87]. However, per- sistence of C. auris within the hospital environment despite disinfection procedures also suggests an involve- ment of the interaction between the pathogen and sur- faces and the length of exposure to disinfectants [88].  adherence to central and peripheral catheter care bun- dles, urinary catheter care bundle, and care of tracheos- tomy sites [78, 79]. If feasible, removal of central catheters or other invasive devices may resolve persistent candidemia and improve clinical outcome [58, 67]. Pa- tients colonized or with proven or suspected C. auris in- fection should be kept in isolation under strict contact precautions until microbiological screening and diagnos- tic results are available [66]. Incoming patients from in- stitutions where proven C. auris isolation has been determined should be screened [78]. Suggested screen- ing sites are groin and axilla, urine, nose and throat, perineal and rectal swab or stool sample. Other high-risk sites may be of consideration, including wounds, cannula entry sites, endotracheal secretions, and drain fluids [70].  C. auris virulence factors C. auris possesses virulence factors, such as germination, adherence, formation of biofilms, and production of phospholipases and proteinases [30]. Table 2 summarizes  (2018) 6:69NANA Table 2 C. auris virulence and resistance factors Virulence genes encoding for: Hemolysin, secreted aspartyl proteinases, secreted lipases, phosphatases, mannosyl transferases, phospholipase, integrins, adhesins, Zn(II) 2 cys 6 transcription factor (strain-specif degree of activity) Resistance genes: Azoles resistance Transport proteins and efflux pumps (ATP-binding cassette ABC; major facilitator superfamilies MFS; upregulation of CDR1, CDR2, MDR1) ERG 11 mutations (substitutions Y132F, K143R, and F126T) and ERG 11 upregulation Echinocandin resistance FKS1/2 (encoding echinocandin drug target 1,3-beta-glucan synthase)Adherence to surfaces and plastic materials (e.g., catheters)Biofilm formation Cellular morphology (aggregating and non-aggregating forms) Rudimentary pseudohyphae formation C. auris is able to survive on a wide range of dry andC. auris virulence and resistance factors. Although com- pared to C. albicans, C. auris forms significantly reduced biofilms, nevertheless, it has the capacity to form adher- ent biofilm communities on a range of clinically import- ant substrates. Larkin et al. studied 16 different C. auris isolates obtained from patients in Japan, India, South Korea, and Germany and characterized their morphology and virulence factors [30]. C. auris produces phospholipase and proteinase in a strain-dependent manner and exhibited a significantly reduced ability to adhere to catheter material as compared to that of C. albicans. Further, C. auris biofilms were mainly com- posed of yeast cells adhering to catheter material. In contrast, C. albicans showed a highly heterogeneous archi- In order to curb transmission, authorities recommend within the extracellular matrix [30]. Sherry et al. described the ability of C. auris to form antifungal-resistant biofilms, against all three main classes of antifungals [87]. These biofilms were shown to be resistant to chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide, displaying a less susceptible phenotype than C. albicans and C. glabrata [87, 89]. More recently, Kean et al. using a molecular approach investigated the genes that are important in causing the C. auris cells to be resistant within the biofilm [89]. Transcriptomic analysis of temporally developing C. auris biofilms was shown to exhibit phase- and antifungal class-dependent resistance profiles. Differential expression analysis demonstrated that 791 and 464 genes were upregulated in biofilm formation and planktonic cells, respectively, with a minimum twofold change. Notably, in the intermediate and mature stages of biofilm development, a number of genes encoding efflux pumps were upregulated, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter suggesting efflux-mediated resistance in C. auris [89]. Pre- viously, Ben-Ami et al. also reported significantly greater ABC-type efflux activity, as evidenced by Rhodamine 6GCortegiani et al. Journal of Intensive Care     transport, among C. auris than C. glabrata isolates sug- gesting efflux-mediated intrinsic resistance of C. auris to azoles [17]. Virulence of C. auris and C. haemulonii has been recently compared with C. glabrata and C. albicans in an immunocompetent murine model of invasive infec- tion. In this study, authors reported that virulence in C. auris appears to be similar to C. albicans and C. glabrata, suggesting that common gene sequences could play a piv- otal role [23]. The whole genome data of the emerging multidrug resistant species and other related Candida re- vealed that C. auris shares some notable expansions of gene family described as related to virulence (including transporters and secreted lipases) in C. albicans and re- lated pathogens [31]. The pathogenicity of C. auris com- pared to that of other common pathogenic yeast species in the invertebrate Galleria mellonella infection demonstrated strain-specific differences in the behavior of C. auris in G. mellonella, with the aggregate-forming isolates exhibiting significantly less pathogenicity than their non-aggregating counterparts. Importantly, the non-aggregating isolates ex- hibited pathogenicity comparable to that of C. albicans [29]. Finally, the ability of salt tolerance and cell clumping into large and difficult to disperse aggregates of C. auris can contribute to its resistance in the hospital environ- ments. Despite the ability to possess the virulence factors, it is observed that the capacity of C. auris to express those is much weaker than that of other Candida spp., suggesting that this emerging species is not as virulent as the latter species [30, 87].  C. auris profile of antifungal resistance and their mechanisms The ability of C. auris to develop resistance to multiple commonly used antifungal agents may be responsible for its high rates of mortality [76]. Antifungal susceptibility data published so far points out that some C. auris strains exhibit elevated minimum inhibitory concentra- tion (MIC) for three major classes of antifungal drugs,  Table 3 Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range and tentative MIC breakpoints of C. auris for most common antifungal drugs.

C. auris is frequently resistant to fluconazole al- though isolates with low MICs against fluconazole (2– 8 mg/L) have also been recorded in India and Colombia [57, 83, 90, 91]. Recently, reports have also documented high MICs to amphotericin B, voriconazole, and caspo- fungin. Antifungal susceptibility testing of 350 isolates of C. auris in 10 hospitals in India over an 8-year period showed that 90% of strains were resistant to flu- conazole (MIC 32 to ≥ 64 mg/L), 2% to echinocandins (MIC ≥ 8 mg/L), 8% to amphotericin B (MIC ≥ 2 mg/L) and 2.3% to voriconazole (MIC 16 mg/L) [90]. In a re- cent report of C. auris candidemia in a tertiary care trauma center in Delhi, India, 45% of C. auris isolates exhibited low MICs of fluconazole [91]. Antifungal sus- ceptibility testing of clinical blood isolates and isolates recovered from environmental and body swabs from hospitals in Colombia revealed that all isolates had low MICs to voriconazole, itraconazole, isavuconazole, and echinocandins [83]. The variable rates of azole resist- ance in different geographic regions suggest localized evolvement of resistance. Although, data underlying the molecular mechanisms related to resistance to common antifungal drug classes in C. auris is scarce, the follow- ing update is based on a few recent studies:a) AzoleThe resistance is mediated by point mutations in the lanosterol 14 α-demethylase (ERG11) gene. Substitutions Y132F, K143R, and F126L in the gene were detected. Moreover, ERG11 gene expression can be increased five- to sevenfold in the presence of fluconazole [90]. This gene, in some strains, can be present in an increased copy number, suggesting that increased copy number may be a mechanism of drug resistance in C. auris [91].NANA MIC range (mcg/ml)Fluconazole Voriconazole (and other 2° generation azoles)Amphotericine BAnidulafungin Caspofungin MicafunginCortegiani et al. Journal of Intensive Care     Mutations in ERG11 gene associated with the develop- ment of fluconazole resistance in C. albicans have been detected in a global collection of 54 C. auris isolates in- cluding amino-acid substitutions specific with geographic clades: F126T with South Africa, Y132F with Venezuela, and Y132F or K143F with India and Pakistan [41]. The ERG11 sequences of Indian C. auris showed amino acid substitutions at position Y132 and K143 for strains that were resistant to fluconazole, whereas genotypes without substitution at these positions were observed in isolates with low MICs of fluconazole (MIC 1–2 mg/L) [90]. These results suggest that these substitutions would give a phenotype of fluconazole resistance. Specific ERG11 sub- stitutions in C. albicans, including F126T, Y132F, and K143R, are directly associated with resistance and have been shown to exhibit reduced susceptibilities to azoles upon heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae [92, 93].  scribed in C. albicans, including upregulation of ERG11 and upregulation of drug efflux pumps (e.g., CDR1, CDR2, MDR1) due to gain of function mutations in transcription factors (e.g., TAC1, MRR1) that induce their expression [94]. The orthologs of transporters from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) classes of efflux proteins have been reported in C. auris. Further, the overexpression of CDR genes members of the ABC family and MDR1 member of the MFS transporters has been recorded in C. auris isolates. Also, a single copy of the multidrug efflux pump MDR1 and 5–6 copy num- bers of multidrug transporters such CDR1, SNQ2, and re- lated genes have been identified in C. auris using WG sequence data [31], while the TAC1 transcription factor that regulates expression of CDR1 and CDR2 is present in two copies in C. auris [31].     tations in the FKS1 gene encoding echinocandin drug target 1,3-beta-glucan synthase. FKS1 gene analysis using C. auris-specific FKS primers in 38 Indian C. auris iso- lates showed that four C. auris isolates exhibited pan-echinocandin resistance (MICs > 8 mg/L). All four resistant isolates had S639F amino acid substitution equivalent to the mutation at position S645 of the hot-spot 1 of FKS1, which is associated with resistance to echinocandins in C. albicans [90]. In contrast, in the remaining 34 C. auris isolates, wild-type phenotype was observed and the isolates exhibited low echinocandin MICs. Also, a single C. auris isolate resistant to both echinocandins and 5-flucytosine obtained from London Cardiothoracic outbreak was investigated for mutation analysis in the later study using WGS displayed SNP, causing a serine to tyrosine substitution (S652Y) in the  (2018) 6:69NANA FKS1 gene [95]. A recent study highlighted the chal- lenges with the antifungal susceptibility testing of C. auris with caspofungin, as FKS1 wildtype isolates exhib- ited an Eagle effect (also known as the paradoxical growth effect). Resistance caused by FKS1 S639F in C. auris was further confirmed in vivo in the mouse model of invasive candidiasis [96]. All isolates were susceptible at a human therapeutic dose of caspofungin, except for those exhibiting the S639F aminoacid substitution. This result suggests that isolates demonstrating echinocandin resistance are characterized by mutations in FKS1 and that routine caspofungin antifungal susceptibility testing by broth microdilution method for C. auris isolates should be cautiously applied or even avoided [96]. How- ever, micafungin is the most potent echinocandin in MIC testing and susceptibility testing with micafungin or FKS1 sequence analysis would be better indicators for Other mechanisms of azole resistance have been de-c) Amphotericin BThe underlying mechanism of amphotericin B resistance has not been investigated so far in C. auris. A recent study by Escandon et al. aimed to describe the overall molecular epidemiology and resistances among Colombian C. auris isolates. The authors found that despite WSG revealed that isolates are genetically related throughout the coun- try, higher resistance rates to amphotericin B were identi- fied in northern regions if compared to central Colombia. Moreover, resistance to amphotericin B has been found to be significantly associated to four newly identified non-synonymous mutations [83]. Furthermore, reported data on susceptibility tests demonstrated that commercial systems (Vitek AST-YS07) could also detect false elevated MICs of amphotericin B. Thus, a cautious approach is rec- b) Echinocandins tibility testing for this yeast [19]. Main mechanisms of echinocandins resistance are mu- Therapy: general concepts and new insights Echinocandins are the first-line therapy for C. auris infec- tion, given resistance to azoles and amphotericine B. As resistance to echinocandins has also been described, pa- tients should undergo close follow-up and microbiological culture-based reassessment to detect therapeutic failure and eventual development of resistances. In cases of unre- sponsiveness to echinocandins, liposomial amphotericin B (as single or combination therapy with an echinocandin) should be prescribed [60, 61, 67, 75] and consultation with an infectious diseases expert is recommended. Further- more, MICs of azoles, such as itraconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole, are low and these drugs show good in vitro activity, possibly explained by the absence of previ- ous exposure of yeast isolates to these agents, or because of the different structure of the azole-target-protein [41].Cortegiani et al. Journal of Intensive Care      [60, 67]. Synergistic interactions may have a possible  role, as demonstrated for micafungin and voriconazole association [23]. Considering the high prevalence and continuous spread of multi-drug resistant isolates of C.  auris, there is the need to expand the classes of available antifungals. SCY-078 showed growth inhibition and anti-biofilm activity against C. auris isolates, with activ-  ity against echinocandin-resistant strains. Moreover, this drug is not affected by common mutations in protein targets and is orally bioavailable [97]. Recently, Basso et  al. described the antifungal properties of θ-defensins, 18-aminoacid macrocyclic peptides with potential appli- cations for therapeutic treatment of systemic MDR in-  fections, representing a template for the future development of new antifungals generation [98]. APX001 is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent for the  treatment of invasive fungal infections, including species resistant to other antifungal drug classes, inhibiting an enzyme (Gwt1) part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol  (GPI) biosynthesis pathway [99]. Results of a study in a murine model of neutropenic disseminated candidiasis conducted by Zhao et al. may have potential relevance for clinical dose selection and breakpoints identification [100]. CD101 is a novel echinocandin with a prolonged half-life and an improved safety profile, allowing once weekly intravenous administration because of its en-  hanced pharmacokinetic properties [101]. In a recent  study, Berkow et al. demonstrated an encouraging in vitro activity against most C. auris isolates, including strains resistant to other echinocandins [101].   Conclusions Scientific community and clinicians are facing increasing incidence of antifungal resistance. Non-albicans Candida spp. infections are progressively emerging in hospitals and  ICUs’ settings. C. auris with high mortality rates,  multi-drug resistance, environmental resilience, and hori- zontal transmission has become an issue in clinical prac-  tice. C. auris MDR strains may continue to emerge  independently and simultaneously throughout the world in next few years. High level of knowledge and alertness  by physicians and healthcare workers, especially in critical  care settings, would help to control the spread and im- prove diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

The extraordinary abilities of C. auris to easily contaminate the environment around colonized patients and persist for long periods have recently re- sulted in major outbreaks in many countries. C. auris resists elimination by robust cleaning and other decontamination procedures, likely due to the formation of ‘dry’ biofilms. Susceptible hospitalized patients, particularly those with multiple comorbidities in intensive care settings, acquire C. auris rather easily from close contact with C. auris-infected patients, their environment, or the equipment used on colonized patients, often with fatal consequences.

Particular emphasis is given to interventions aiming to prevent new infections in healthcare facilities, including the screening of susceptible patients for colonization; the cleaning and decontamination of the environment, equipment, and colonized patients; and successful approaches to identify and treat infected patients, particularly during outbreaks.Keywords: Candida auris; epidemiology; pathogenesis; diagnosis; antifungal susceptibility; environ- mental contamination; infection control; environmental decontaminationNANA1. IntroductionCandida and other yeast species are part of the microbiome on human skin, mucousmembranes, the female genital tract, and the gastrointestinal tract [1,2]. Of nearly 150 Can-dida species described in the literature, only ~10% are known to cause human infections (candidiasis) [3]. The infections range in severity from mild, localized infections (suchNA as vaginitis) to more serious, life-threatening deep-seated invasive infections and can-didemia [3,4]. The incidence of candidemia is increasing worldwide, and Candida spp. arenow recognized as the fourth most common cause of bloodstream/invasive infections, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) settings in many tertiary care hospitals, where at least 50% episodes of candidemia occur [3–5]. Candida spp. are also among the four most common causes of late onset septicemia in very-low-birth-weight neonates and infants [6,7]. Major risk factors for invasive Candida infections include multiple comorbidities, such asextremes of age, being hospitalized in ICU, total parenteral nutrition, diabetes mellitus, neu-NA tropenia, pneumonia or chronic pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular diseases, sepsis, thepresence of central venous catheters, urinary tract infection, urinary catheters or acute renalfailure, malignancy, prior or concomitant bacterial infection, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents, and immunosuppressive therapy [8–11]. Candidemia has an attributable mortality of 15–35% in adults and 10–15% in neonates [12].NANAhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganismsMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                           2 of 25NANA Candida albicans is the most common causative agent of candidemia and invasive candidiasis; however, >50% of all infections are now caused by other non-albicans Candida species, and their spectrum is rapidly changing [13–20]. Non-albicans Candida species have increased in prevalence in many geographical settings, likely due to the increasing use of fluconazole/other antifungal drugs for prophylaxis and therapy. This has resulted in the selection of Candida spp. with reduced susceptibility to antifungal drugs, and infections are now associated with higher mortality rates as they often lead to adverse clinical outcomes [19,21–25]. In recent years, we have witnessed an increasing number of reports describing invasive infections by multidrug-resistant Candida spp. in various medical centers worldwide [18,19,22,26–28]. The emerging multidrug-resistant Candida spp. include Candida glabrata, Candida guilliiermondii complex members, Candida krusei, Candida lusitaniae, Candida lipolytica, Candida rugosa, Candida kefyr, Candida haemulonii complex members, and Candida auris [18,19,22,26–29]. Among these potentially multidrug-resistant Candida spp., C. auris has attracted a great amount of attention in recent years as it has been linked to major outbreaks of invasive infections in healthcare facilities around the globe [29–32]. In this article, we describe the current epidemiology of C. auris infections and discuss recent approaches to diagnosis, drug resistance, infection prevention, and control measures adopted for C. auris to protect susceptible inpatient populations in healthcare facilities.2. Epidemiology of C. auris Infections Candida auris is a recently recognized, multidrug-resistant pathogenic yeast that causes invasive infections and outbreaks with high mortality rates in hospitalized patients, partic- ularly among patients with multiple comorbidities and who have been admitted to ICU or other special care facilities [29–32]. It was first isolated from the external ear canal of a Japanese patient and described as a novel Candida species in 2009 [33]. Soon afterwards, 15 other ear isolates collected from 2004 to 2006, which were previously misidentified as Candida haemulonii, were described in South Korea [34]. The first six invasive isolates from three patients (including two bloodstream isolates recovered from a 1-year-old girl in 1996) were also described in South Korea in 2011 [35]. Within a decade of its discovery as a novel bloodstream pathogen, >4000 isolates were recovered from blood and other speci- mens from several countries on all inhabited continents [29–32,36]. As of 15 February 2021, 47 countries have reported a single case or cluster of cases or outbreaks of C. auris infections, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States of America (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html accessed on 31 March 2021). The epidemiology of invasive C. auris infections has seen dramatic changes, as the sporadic invasive infections from the early years have now been replaced by nosocomial outbreaks that are being reported more frequently and appear to involve an increasing number of patients [29–32,37–39]. Studies have shown that once C. auris is introduced into a healthcare facility, it spreads rapidly among susceptible patients [40,41]. Thus far, C. auris outbreaks have been reported from the United States of America [42–45], Canada [46], Mexico [47], the United Kingdom [48,49], Spain [50,51], India [40,52], Pak- istan [53], Russia [54], Saudi Arabia [55], Oman [56,57], Kuwait [58], Kenya [59], South Africa [60], and Colombia [61]. Studies describing single/multiple invasive infections and outbreaks in different countries or geographical locations in the last several years have been extensively reviewed, only some of which are cited here [29–32,38]. For a comprehensive listing and chronological order of countries reporting C. auris cases between January 2009 and June 2020 and all major outbreaks, readers are directed to two recently published excellent reviews [62,63]. The number of patients affected and the mortality rates in some selected outbreaks reported recently from January 2019 to January 2021 are shown in Table 1. As a result of the increasing incidence of C. auris infections, the epidemiology of invasive Candida infections has changed dramatically in recent years and C. auris has now become a major bloodstream pathogen, even surpassing C. glabrata or C. tropicalis in some healthcare facilities/geographical settings [41,52,60,64–66].Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807                  Saudi Arabia                                                 3 of 25NANA Table 1.

Fur- thermore, very high rates of resistance to fluconazole and variable susceptibility to other azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins make the management of C. auris infections ex- tremely difficult [37,56–58,71–73]. Crude mortality rates varying from 0 to 72% have been reported among C. auris-infected patients in different studies [29–32,37,48,52,56–58,74]. C. auris frequently colonizes the axilla, groin, nares, respiratory tract, and urinary tract in hospitalized patients [29–32,58,75–78]. The environmental screening of patient’s room sur- faces and environment including clothing and equipment have yielded C. auris isolates with identical fingerprinting patterns, suggesting the shedding of C. auris by colonized patients into the environment [48,75–80]. C. auris has also been shown to persist on reusable skin- surface axillary temperature probes, which coincides with the higher isolation frequency of C. auris from the axilla from colonized patients than other body sites [29–32,44,58,75–78]. Studies have shown that the rate of C. auris colonization in skilled nursing facilities caring for ventilated patients are 10 times higher than its occurrence in nursing facilities without ventilator support [81,82]. The risk factors for the development of invasive C. au- ris infections are similar to those for other pathogenic Candida species [29–32,58,83,84]. Previous studies have shown that C. auris colonization results in invasive infections in nearly 10% of colonized individuals, and mechanical ventilation and the placement of invasive devices are two major risk factors for the development of invasive infections due to C. auris [48,77,78]. Two recent studies have also shown that other common risk factors for the development of candidemia in C. auris colonized patients include total parenteral nutrition, sepsis, longer duration of arterial or central venous catheters, the presence of advanced chronic kidney disease, prior antibiotic use, previous surgery, prolonged ICU stay, and multifocal colonization [65,66]. C. auris also has the ability to form ‘dry’ biofilms and aggregative phenotypes which are not easily eradicated [70,77,85–88]. These charac- teristics promote the person-to-person transmission of infection through direct/indirect contact in hospital settings rather easily [70,77,85,88].3. Identification of C. auris in Culture Isolates and Clinical Specimens The accurate identification of C. auris is crucial for providing optimal patient care, the appropriate treatment of patients with invasive infections, and identifying colonized patients to initiate infection prevention and control measures. C. auris isolates are usually misidentified as Candida haemulonii, Candida duobushaemulonii, Candida sake, Rhodotorula glutinis, or other Candida species by routinely used phenotypic methods in clinical microbi- ology laboratories around the world until recently [29–32,78,89]. At 40 ◦ C, they are able to grow in Sabouraud broth and yeast nitrogen base containing 10% NaCl supplemented with dextrose, dulcitol, or mannitol, while C. haemulonii, C. duobushaemulonii, C. albicans, and C. parapsilosis fail to grow under these conditions and C. glabrata isolates grow only in Sabouraud broth containing dextrose [44,68]. However, accurate identification by growth atMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                  Culture-dependent tests                                                               4 of 25NANA higher temperatures (40–42 ◦ C) or growth in the presence of high (10%) salt concentration are not completely specific for C. auris [44,77,90–92]. The methods commonly used for the identification of C. auris in culture isolates and clinical specimens are summarized in Table 2.Table 2.

Furthermore, C. auris also undergoes morphological switching between pink, white, and dark purple colony phenotypes when grown on CHROMagar Candida medium [107]. A new chromogenic selective medium, CHROMagarTM Candida Plus has been developed recently; C. auris forms distinct cream-colored colonies with a blue halo after 48 h of incubation at 37 ◦ C and is easily differentiated from other Candida species, including C. haemulonii complex members [94]. CHROMagar Candida medium supplemented with Pal’s medium has also been shown to be useful for the differentiation of C. auris from other C. haemulonii complex members [108]. C. auris isolates were also routinely misidentified, mostly as C. haemulonii or Rhodotorula glutinis, by automated yeast identification systems such as Vitek2 (Vitek2 YST) until re- cently [30,34,36,78]. However, Vitek2 YST with upgraded software (version 8.01 which includes C. auris) and other automated yeast identification systems now usually identify C. auris accurately [41,77,78]. Even then, all clinical isolates identified as C. haemulonii, C. duobushaemulonii, C. famata, and C. auris should be confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) or by DNA sequencing (described below) to avoid misidentification. MALDI-TOF MS systems such as Bruker-Daltonics MALDI Biotyper and VITEK MS by bioMeriaux accurately identify C. auris only with their updated databases representing all the phylogenetic clades (re- search use only) or United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved system databases [39,77,78,95–97]. Definitive identification is usually achieved by the PCR amplifi- cation of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and/or by PCR sequencing of the ITS region or the D1/D2 domains of rDNA [29–32,41,93,106]. Although whole genomeMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                            5 of 25NANA sequencing has been performed to determine phylogenetic relationships among C. auris isolates during outbreak investigations, a highly discriminatory, 12-loci-based short tandem repeat typing scheme has also recently been described for the routine fingerprinting of C. auris isolates, which yields nearly comparable results [56,58,79,109]. Although automated yeast identification systems such as Vitek2 YST have been im- proved to correctly identify C. auris as stated above, they are slow yielding results in days rather than in hours. More recently, culture-independent methods have been developed for the detection of C. auris in few hours to allow the rapid identification of colonized patients. Both in-house [93,99,106] and commercial PCR-based assays [99–102,104,105] are available. These tests have performed well during clinical evaluations in which culture was used as the gold standard and have yielded >90% clinical sensitivities and specificities. The Taqman qPCR approach has been successfully adapted with the commercial BD Max system for easier, rapid and automated detection of C. auris [101,102]. In a recent study, Sattler et al. [104] evaluated the performance of two commercial (AurisID, OLM Diagnostics and Fungiplex Candida auris RUO) rt-PCR assays and showed that AurisID assay was more sensitive than the Fungiplex Candida auris RUO test. However, AurisID also yielded false positive results, with a high quantity of DNA from other closely related species, while no false positive results were obtained with the other test [104]. Other culture-independent tests have also been developed; however, their performance with clinical samples has not yet been fully evaluated to warrant routine use [93,98,106,110].4. Origin of C. auris as a Major Fungal Pathogen and Virulence Attributes Although C. auris was first described in 2009, retrospective analyses of culture collec- tions have identified other C. auris isolates obtained previously that were usually misiden- tified as C. haemulonii, including a bloodstream isolate collected in 1996 [34,35]. Phyloge- netically, C. auris is closely related to C. haemulonii complex members [36,111]. Despite highly clonal nature of C. auris, whole genome sequence analyses have identified five distinct clades which differ from each other by thousands of single-nucleotide polymor- phisms [89,112,113]. These clades are identified by their geographical origin and include South Asian Clade (Clade I), East Asian Clade (Clade II), African Clade (Clade III), South American Clade (Clade IV), and Iranian Clade (Clade V). Interestingly Clade I, III, and IV isolates cause invasive infections and outbreaks frequently, while Clade II isolates exhibit a predilection for the ear which is not normally seen for other isolates [95]. The recently described Clade V isolate was also initially recovered from a case of otomycoses [113,114]. C. auris strains exhibit clade-specific resistance to fluconazole, with varying susceptibil- ity to other azoles, echinocandins, and amphotericin B, with many isolates exhibiting a multidrug-resistant phenotype [40,71,73,89,95]. Whole-genome sequence comparisons have also shown that different C. auris clades have emerged on different continents nearly simultaneously [89,112,113]. Thermotolerance and salinity tolerance (or osmotolerance) are two unique characteris- tics of C. auris that distinguish it from its close relatives belonging to the C. haemulonii com- plex [29,38,62,63]. Considering the rather recent emergence of this novel yeast pathogen, the simultaneous origin of different clades that differ from each other in thousands of single nucleotides polymorphisms is highly intriguing. It has recently been suggested that C. auris initially emerged from a common ancestor, migrated to different geographical locations, and diversified genetically, most likely driven by antifungal prescribing prac- tices [115]. Another study that compared the temperature tolerance of C. auris with that of other Candida species had suggested that C. auris might have previously existed as a plant saprophyte in specialized ecosystems and that climate change, specifically global warming, may have contributed to its ability to grow at higher temperatures and its evolu- tion as a human pathogen (global warming emergence hypothesis) [116]. The authors also suggested a natural wetland or marine (warmer and osmotolerant) environmental niche for C. auris [116]. Another study also proposed the aquatic environment as the natural habitat of C. auris, as it was used as a prey by two free-living amoebae and proliferatedMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                    6 of 25NANA when exposed to protozoal supernatants [117]. Taking a cue from these observations, Arora et al. [118] explored the tropical marine ecosystems around very isolated Andaman Islands, Union Territory of India in the Indian Ocean, and isolated several Clade I C. auris from two sites, the virgin habitat of salt marsh area with no human activity and from a sandy beach [118]. The study thus succeeded in isolating C. auris for the first time from the tropical coastal environment, outside of the usual hospital environmental settings, suggesting its association with the marine ecosystem. Interestingly, the two isolates from the salt marsh area included a multidrug-susceptible and a multidrug-resistant C. auris while all 22 iso- lates from the beach site were resistant to multiple antifungal drugs [118]. Additionally, all the isolates grew at higher temperatures, however, the multidrug-susceptible isolate from the salt marsh grew slower than other isolates at both 37 ◦ C and 42 ◦ C [118]. Based on the isolation of C. auris from tropical marine ecosystems and the observation that one multidrug-susceptible isolate (from salt marsh) grew slower at mammalian temperatures than other environmental (or clinical) strains, Casadevall et al. [119] have suggested that these findings provide an environmental source for clinical isolates and that the common ancestor of C. auris has likely adapted to higher temperatures recently. It remains to be seen whether additional environmental C. auris will be found from similar ecological sites around the globe that will be more closely related to organisms belonging to other clades. The virulence factors associated with C. auris infections are not completely understood. The adherence of the pathogenic yeasts such as C. albicans to the host surface takes place with the help of yeast cell surface adhesion proteins such as agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) proteins (Als1-7, Als9), hyphal wall protein 1 (Hwp1), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glucan-cross-linked cell wall protein (Eap1) and a GPI-anchored protein 30 (Pga1) [120]. On the other hand, C. glabrata relies on epithelial adhesins (Epa) (a subtelomeric gene family) and Epa-like proteins for its attachment to host cells [120]. Genome comparisons have shown that C. auris has the capacity to adapt to different environments and possesses many pathogenic mechanisms which are in common with C. albicans and other Candida species [30,63,89,112,121]. C. auris pathogenic attributes that have been identified include pathways required for cell wall modelling and nutrient acquisition, two-component systems, the production of hydrolytic enzymes such as phospholipases and proteinases likely involved in the adherence of the yeast and the invasion of host cells and tissues during infections, other mechanisms of tissue invasion, and immune evasion and multidrug efflux systems [63,89,112,121–123]. C. auris genome encodes lytic enzymes such as secreted aspartyl proteases (SAPs) as well as secreted lipases, phospholipases, and proteases (YPS) [121]. C. auris genome also encodes orthologs of several C. albicans factors that are implicated in adhesion, biofilm formation and virulence [121]. Interestingly, sections of subtelomeric regions that are enriched in putative adhesins are present in outbreak-associated Clade I, Clade II, and Clade IV strains but have been lost by Clade II strains comprising mostly drug-susceptible organisms and associated mainly with ear infections [124]. Other adhesin genes identified in C. auris include orthologs of agglutinin, such as sequence (ALS)3 and ALS4 of C. albicans, while the Als3 protein (Als3p) was also detected on C. auris cell surface by anti-C. albicans Als3p antibodies [63,125]. The C. albicans Als3p acts like an adhesin and invasin that mediates attachment to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix proteins and induces host cell endocytosis of C. albicans hyphae [120,126]. C. auris virulence factors and genes conferring resistance to antifungal drugs are presented in Table 3.Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                                        7 of 25NANA Table 3.

C. auris has been cultured from several indwelling medical de- vices, such as catheters, central/peripheral line tips, and neurological shunts [123,139,140]. C. auris forms ‘dry’ biofilms on environmental surfaces and equipment (such as reusable temperature probes) in the hospital and so can remain viable for several months [70,127]. The biofilm-forming ability of C. auris has aided its role as a persistent colonizer and difficult to eradicate pathogen from the hospital environment [80,85–88]. Biofilm formation also protects this organism from antifungal drugs, as was demonstrated by transcriptional analyses and mature biofilms (24 h duration) exhibited resistance to triazoles, polyenes, and echinocandins [128,141]. Kean et al. [128] showed that seven adhesin genes (IFF4, CSA1, PGA26, PGA52, PGA7, HYR3 and ALS5) are upregulated during biofilm formation. Of these, 4 glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell wall genes (IFF4, CSA1, PGA26 and PGA52) were upregulated at all (4, 12 and 24 h) time points during in vitro biofilm formation, while two adhesin genes (HYR3 and ALS5) were upregulated only in mature (24 h old) biofilms [128,129]. Furthermore, a number of genes, particularly those encoding efflux pumps such as MDR and CDR homologs and glucan-modifying enzymes with key role in biofilm extracellular matrix formation were upregulated during biofilm formation, and their inhibition improved the susceptibility of biofilms to fluconazole [128,141,142]. The biofilm-forming capacity of C. auris likely has a role in pathogenicity, as many studies have described the clearance of C. auris infections in patients after the removal of urinary or central venous catheters [40,50,84,143]. Both morphologic and metabolic plasticity confer an edge for virulence in bacterial and fungal pathogens as this versatility allow the pathogenic organisms to rapidly adapt to different environmental conditions [120,144–146]. Different age-dependent phenotypes of C. auris have also been described which differ in their susceptibility to antifungal drugs. One study described increased antifungal resistance as a result of transient gene duplica- tion [136]. Compared to younger (0–3 generations) C. auris cultures, older (>10 generations) cells exhibited increased tolerance to all four classes of antifungal drugs and older genera- tions of even fluconazole-susceptible cells could survive in very high (up to 256 µg/mL) drug concentration and were unresponsive to fluconazole treatment in Galleria mellonella infection model [136]. The decreased susceptibility resulted from both gene duplication and the increased expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (CDR1) and lanosterol demethylase (ERG11), with older C. auris cells showing an 8-fold upregulation of the main azole target gene, ERG11 [136].Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                            8 of 25NANA Although metabolic flexibility has been studied in great detail and has been shown to be successfully used by C. albicans for virulence [120,146], its role in the pathogenesis of C. auris is poorly defined. A recent study has shown that, unlike C. haemulonii and C. albicans, mannan in C. auris is highly enriched in β-1,2-linkages which are important for its interactions with IgG (found in blood and sweat glands) and with the mannose binding lectin (found in blood). The bonding of C. auris mannan to IgG was found to be 12- to 20-fold stronger than mannan from C. albicans. The findings suggest that the unique mannan of C. auris likely has a role in its increased colonization of humans [135]. However, the role of morphologic plasticity has been studied in more detail in C. auris. C. auris is a budding yeast; however, some strains fail to release daughter cell after bud- ding, resulting in the formation of aggregates of pseudohyphal-like cells which cannot be disrupted physically or chemically with detergents [123]. C. auris isolates producing aggre- gates of pseudohyphal-like cells were found to be less pathogenic in the Galleria mellonella infection model, while non-aggregate-forming C. auris strains exhibited pathogenicity comparable to that of C. albicans [123]. The ability to aggregate was subsequently shown to be an inducible trait as aggregate formation was stimulated by the prior exposure of C. auris to triazoles or echinocandins [130]. A more recent study has shown that the mortality rates between aggregative and non-aggregative C. auris strains were nearly same; however, clinical isolates were significantly more pathogenic than reference C. auris strains [147]. Aggregative phenotypes of C. auris have predominantly been isolated from colonized patients and have higher capacity for biofilm formation than non-aggregative phenotypes, and these findings are consistent with the difficulties encountered in the eradication of C. auris from most of the colonized patients [70,88]. On the contrary, in the mouse model of infection, the aggregation of yeast cells has been observed in kidneys of mice that died due to infection, suggesting that aggregate formation may help the yeast to evade immune recognition and thus facilitate its persistence in tissues [139]. Another study has shown that the C5 complement deficiency in A/J mice results in rapid C. auris proliferation in target organs, with fatal outcomes, while C57BL/6J mice and mice deficient in neutrophil elastase survive high-dose C. auris intravenous challenge, even after cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression [131]. These contrasting results are likely due to differences in the virulence of C. auris strains tested and/or the infection model. Although most fungi do not survive at normal physiological temperatures (36.5 ◦ C to 37.5 ◦ C) or during conditions of pyrexia (~40 ◦ C) and are thus unable to colonize humans and cause infections, C. auris is capable of growing at higher (>40 ◦ C) tempera- tures [62,63,68,132]. Similarly, unlike its close relatives (C. haemulonii complex members), C. auris is also able to tolerate high (>10% NaCl) salt concentrations [63,68,132]. Thermotol- erance and osmotolerance are two important characteristics that may help in the persistence and survival of C. auris on biotic and abiotic surfaces for long periods of time [48,85,132]. The Hog1-related stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) signaling pathway plays a key role in the C. auris response to osmotic stress [129]. The Hog1 SAPK is a highly conserved stress-sensing and signaling protein (C. auris Hog1 exhibits an 87% sequence identity with C. albicans sequence) and a key virulence factor in many human fungal pathogens [124,128]. Day et al. [148] showed that wild-type C. auris forms oval yeast cells; however, the deletion of Hog1 resulted in larger elongated cells that clustered together and mutant cells became more sensitive to damage by anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Further- more, fluorescence microscopy revealed that hog1 deletion mutants had more exposed chitin indicating that Hog1 plays important roles in cellular morphology, aggregation, and cell wall structure in C. auris [148]. Additionally, deletion mutants were sensitive to cationic stress imposed by NaCl or KCl or to high concentrations of sorbitol (osmotic stress). The study also showed that Hog1 is required for the resistance of C. auris to the reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide) and to highly acidic environments, but it was dispensable for growth in alkaline and moderately acidic environments and for the resistance to the organic oxidative stress-inducing agents [148]. In the invertebrate model host Caenorhabditis elegans, wild-type C. auris was more pathogenic than Hog1-deleted cells, clearly demonstratingMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                            9 of 25NANA that Hog1 SAPK is an important pathogenicity determinant in C. auris [148]. C. auris is known to survive on human skin and environmental surfaces for several weeks to months and is known to tolerate exposure to some commonly used disinfectants. Persistence on surfaces may contribute its transmission within healthcare settings. For instance, the first C. auris outbreak in the United Kingdom was linked to the use of reusable axillary temperature probes [48]. In C. albicans, phenotypic switching, an adaptation to survive in a harsh environment, is stimulated by several factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, abnormal pH/temperature or nutrient limitation as well as exposure to biological factors present in serum, and involves global changes in gene expression that are controlled by white-opaque regulator (WOR)1 [149]. Similar to the yeast-hyphal transition and white-opaque switching observed in C. albicans, C. auris also undergoes morphological switching between pink, white, and dark purple colony phenotypes when grown on CHROMagar Candida medium likely as a result of distinct cellular oxidative/reductive states [107]. The C. auris genome encoded three genes homologous to Wor1 which could potentially control phenotypic switching in C. auris. The identification of phenotypic switching in C. auris has also led CDC to alert diagnostic facilities to exercise caution when using morphological features for its screening [107]. Phenotypic switching is also observed in C. glabrata, resulting in four colony phenotypes of white, light brown, dark brown, and very dark brown colonies when it is grown on nutrient agar medium containing copper sulfate or phloxine B [150]. Apparently, C. auris colonies undergo this transitioning at a higher rate than the white- opaque switch frequencies observed in C. albicans [107]. It remains to be seen whether this phenotypic switching is heritable and also whether it is associated with virulence and/or antifungal drug resistance in C. auris. The formation of true hyphae is another feature of pathogenic Candida species which is important for the invasion of host tissue [151]. Although C. auris is known to form pseudo-hyphae, it has not been shown to form true hyphae until recently [88,123]. Recent studies have shown that C. auris isolates can form true hyphae under certain defined condi- tions. For instance, the growth of C. auris on yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium supplemented with 10% NaCl induced the formation of elongated/pseudohyphal-like cells at both 37 ◦ C and 42 ◦ C in one recent study [152]. It was further shown that the addition of an Hsp90 inhibitor also led to the formation of pseudohyphal-like cells, similar to Hsp90-mediated temperature-dependent filamentation in C. albicans [153,154]. Another study based on a systemic infection model has shown that a subset of C. auris cells could undergo filamentation after passage through the mouse and three distinct phenotypes (typical yeast cells, filamentation-competent yeast cells, and filamentous-form cells) were detected [133]. Surprisingly, filamentation-competent yeast cells upon subsequent growth on YPD medium at cooler temperatures (<25 ◦ C) showed robust filamentation and were described as “filamentous-form cells” which, under the microscope, looked morphologi- cally similar to true hyphae produced by C. albicans [62,133,151]. However, in contrast to the true hyphae and yeast forms of C. albicans which are observed at 37 ◦ C and at lower temperatures, respectively [151], lower temperature conditions (<25 ◦ C) promoted while growth at 37 ◦ C repressed filamentous growth in C. auris [62,133]. Furthermore, switching between the typical yeast form and the filamentation-competent yeast form, though rare in C. auris, was heritable when it did occur while switching between the filamentation- competent yeast cells and filamentous-form cells was nonheritable and dependent on the cooler environment [133]. The yeast and filamentous-form C. auris showed differences in global gene expression profiles, the expression of virulence factors, and the increased expression of genes involved in sugar transportation, glycolysis, and energy production, indicating more active metabolism in filamentous cells compared to yeast cells [62,133]. Yue et al. [133] also showed that several genes homologous to C. albicans hyphal regulators are upregulated in filamentous cells, suggesting a similarity in the process of filamentation in C. auris and C. albicans. Their differential expression data showed that G1 cyclin-related protein gene (HGC1) and a GPI anchored protein gene (ALS4) are upregulated in fila-Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                            10 of 25NANA mentous form C. auris cells. The study further showed that conserved transcriptional regulator-encoding genes (CPH1 and FLO8) that control filamentous growth in C. albicans as well as GPI-anchored cell wall related genes PGA31 and PGA45 are also upregulated in filamentous-form C. auris cells [133]. Interestingly, WOR1 was downregulated in filamen- tous form C. auris cells [133]. More recently, clinical C. auris isolates belonging to all four major clades were shown to form multiple (yeast, filamentous, aggregated and elongated forms) colony and cellular morphologies that differed in antifungal resistance and virulence properties in the G. mellonella infection model, suggesting the presence of these features as general characteristics of this organism [134]. Taken together, these studies suggest that filamentous forms of C. auris could exist in the cooler hospital environment and perhaps also on the skin of colonized patients, where the temperature could be markedly lower and could be more virulent if they gain access to the inside of the susceptible patients with multiple comorbidities, particularly in ICU settings.5. Susceptibility of C. auris to Antifungal Drugs An important reason for C. auris to be known as a “superbug” in recent years is its in- trinsic resistance to one, more and sometimes to all available antifungal drugs [30,37,62,73]. Generally, C. auris strains exhibit very high rates of resistance to fluconazole and a variable susceptibility to other azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, which makes the anti- fungal management of C. auris infections, particularly invasive infections in patients with multiple comorbidities, extremely difficult [29–32,39,58,62]. Currently, there are no estab- lished susceptibility breakpoints for C. auris. However, tentative breakpoints have been suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) based on expert opin- ion and those established for other closely related Candida species [62,72,73,89,155,156]. The following tentative breakpoints have been proposed for classifying drug-resistant strains: fluconazole, >32 µg/mL; amphotericin B, 2 µg/mL; caspofungin 2 µg/mL; micafungin 4 µg/mL; and anidulafungin 4 µg/mL. C. auris strains from around the world exhibit a clade-specific resistance to flu- conazole but varying susceptibility to other triazoles, amphotericin B, and echinocan- dins [62,72,73,89,155]. For instance, nearly 90%, 30%, and ~5% of C. auris isolates from the USA have been reported to be resistant to fluconazole, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, while the corresponding values for C. auris isolates from India have been reported as 90–95%, 7–37%, and <2%, respectively [71,73,79]. Although the resistance rates to flucona- zole are usually very high, only a few Clade II isolates are resistant to fluconazole and susceptibility to other triazoles varies widely even among isolates belonging to the same clade [39,58,62,73,95,157]. The current knowledge of genes conferring resistance to antifun- gal drugs are listed in Table 3. The cytochrome P450-dependent lanosterol demethylase involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and encoded by ERG11 is the main target conferring resistance to fluconazole [71,73,89]. Three nonsynonymous (F126L, Y132F, and K143R) mutations have been detected in ERG11 in fluconazole-resistant C. auris isolates belonging to different genetic clades with Y132F and K143R being more common [71,73,89]. Although ERG11 gene mutations are strongly associated with resistance to fluconazole in clinical C. auris isolates, their presence alone does not completely explain the entirety of resistance observed clinically, clearly implying the role(s) of other genetic and molecular mechanisms in fluconazole resistance [41,58,71,79,158]. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the molecular basis of resistance to triazoles is much more complex than previously thought. C. auris genome encodes several members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (CDR1) and major facilitator superfamily (MFS) members (MDR1) that coincides with the exceptional multidrug resistance characteristic of this organism and some C. auris isolates with K143R mutation in ERG11 gene were found to contain two copies of the MDR1 gene encoding for a major facilitator transporter [79,89,136–138]. The CDR1 and MDR1 homologs are highly expressed in triazole-resistant C. auris, and the deletion of CDR1 causes a >100-fold decrease in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for triazoles, suggesting that the overexpression of CDR1 is a significantMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                        11 of 25NANA contributor to clinical triazole resistance in C. auris [137]. Another study showed that both in vitro-generated and clinical fluconazole-resistant C. auris isolates contained nonsynony- mous mutations in TAC1B, encoding zinc-cluster transcription factor and showed increased expression of CDR1 relative to the parental clinical isolate [138]. Nonsynonymous mutation A640V was detected in TAC1B in 57 Clade I isolates containing ERG11 K143R mutation, nonsynonymous mutation A657V, and frameshift deletion mutation between codons F862 and N866 were detected in 15 and 46 Clade I isolates, respectively, containing ERG11 Y132F mutation and nonsynonymous mutations K247E, M653V and A651T were detected in 5, 7, and 16 Clade IV isolates, respectively, with no ERG11 mutations [138]. More importantly, gene replacement studies confirmed the role of the most common (A640V) TAC1B mutation as this mutation increased fluconazole MIC 8-fold when introduced into a fluconazole- susceptible strain while the reverse experiment caused 16-fold decrease in fluconazole MIC [138]. Furthermore, a nonsynonymous (G145D) mutation has also been found in YMC1, encoding several transmembrane transporter activities essential in mitochondrial transport in some fluconazole-resistant C. auris isolates lacking the K143R mutation in ERG11 [79]. Thus, mutations in TAC1B and YMC1 also contribute to clinical fluconazole resistance in C. auris. Resistance rates to amphotericin B also vary considerably, with one study reporting >60% of C. auris isolates as resistant to this polyene drug [39,41,71,89,141]. The molecular basis of resistance to polyenes in C. auris is poorly defined [73]. Resistance to polyenes in C. albicans and other Candida species is mediated by mutations in genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, particularly ERG2 and ERG6 [28,73,159]. In one study which interrogated ERG genes in C. auris isolates from the United Kingdom with a reduced susceptibility to amphotericin B, no resistance conferring-mutations were detected [49]. However, Yadav et al. [79] recently showed that all amphotericin B-resistant C. auris isolates contain a novel nonsynonymous (G145D) mutation in ERG2. Another study has shown the involvement of two-component signal transduction system and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in conferring resistance to AMB in C. auris [160]. Further studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to amphotericin B in C. auris are clearly warranted. Among echinocandins, caspofungin often yields inconsistent results during antifungal susceptibility testing, likely due to paradoxical growth (also known as Eagle effect) of C. au- ris isolates [49,58,72]. The molecular basis of resistance of C. auris to echinocandins typically involves nonsynonymous mutations in the hotspot-1 (HS-1) region of FKS1 encoding 1,3 β- D-glucan synthase [71–73]. The most common genetic alteration observed in echinocandin- resistant isolates involves the S639F mutation in HS-1 of the FKS1 gene [41,71–73]. Other nonsynonymous mutations (S639Y and S639P) and the deletion of F635 have also been described in C. auris and other Candida species isolates with a reduced susceptibility to echinocandins [41,49,58,71,161–163].6. C. auris Infection Prevention and Control Measures in Healthcare Facilities Considering the exceptional ability of this organism to cause outbreaks and the very high mortality rates reported among affected patients, specific recommendations and guidelines have been published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of USA [164], the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) [165] and Public Health England [166] for controlling C. auris outbreaks in healthcare facilities and are summarized in Table 4. Major infection control practices include the identification of invasive C. auris cases and colonized patients, standard precautions including hand hygiene and personal protection practices, environmental cleaning, and patient decolonization.Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807         Identification of C. auris cases                                                                                        12 of 25NANA Table 4.

Cases of C. auris Fungemia and Other Invasive Infections As stated above, the risk factors for invasive C. auris infections are similar to those for other pathogenic Candida species and include immunosuppressed state, multiple comor- bidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung or kidney disease, recent surgery, par- enteral nutrition, urinary or central venous catheters, exposure to broad spectrum antimicro- bials/antifungals, ventilator support, and stay in ICU settings [29–32,58,75–77]. Although C. auris, in addition to fungemia, has also been implicated to cause ventriculitis, pericarditis,Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                            13 of 25NANA complicated pleural effusions and intra-abdominal infections, osteomyelitis, malignant otitis/otomastoiditis, meningitis and vulvovaginitis, its role in respiratory, urinary and skin and soft tissue infections remains uncertain [30,33,34,43,48,50,60,74,89,139,167,168]. Due to its multidrug-resistant nature and extraordinary ability to spread rapidly in healthcare facilities causing outbreaks with associated high mortality rates [30,42–45,51–58], the detec- tion of even a single case of C. auris should trigger an epidemiological investigation and the implementation of infection control measures and contact precautions to prevent further transmission [77,78,141]. This requires the capacity of hospital microbiology laboratory to efficiently and correctly identify C. auris and, following the detection of positive cases, the institution of robust infection control measures which include alerting treating infectious disease specialists and notification to institutional authorities for setting up outbreak man- agement teams. It has been observed that delays in the recognition of C. auris infection or colonization and delays in the implementation of strict infection control practices typi- cally results in the rapid transmission of C. auris among other patients sharing common facilities/equipment [41,48,50,55–58].6.2. Colonization of Hospitalized Patients with C. auris Due to the variable case definition and screening practices for Candida species, colo- nization rates and the specific significance of colonization with respect to the development of subsequent invasive infections have been difficult to measure. Although C. parapsilosis has been known to cause outbreaks in healthcare facilities [169–171], most other Candida infections are usually endogenous in origin as opportunistic Candida spp. are part of the microbiome in humans [1,2,172]. C. auris is highly transmissible among patients, likely due to its tendency to persistently colonize skin and other body sites and is shed into the environment [30,38,41,58,75,79–81]. Patients undergoing invasive procedures or the placement of invasive devices are at greater risk of acquiring C. auris bloodstream infec- tion with catheters providing an easy access for the fungus to enter bloodstream [38,40]. Colonization has been detected in multiple body sites among outbreak patients and has persisted for >24 months in some patients [41,48,50,58,75]. The anatomic sites usually colonized with C. auris include axilla, groin, nose, rectum, respiratory tract, and urinary tract [41,44,48,50,55–58,79]. A pertinent question that has remained largely unanswered is whether C. auris is present in the community or is solely confined to the hospital environment. The screening of new patients for yeasts in general or C. auris in particular is not a routine practice in most healthcare facilities, likely due to a lack of perceived importance of yeast colonization. However, few studies have reported on the screening of newly admitted patients for C. auris in the hospital settings. The study from the United Kingdom detected C. auris in only one among nearly 2200 newly admitted patients, a finding reflecting the low prevalence of C. auris infections in newly hospitalized patients [48]. Another study from the USA also detected the organism only in those patients who had previously been exposed to the hospital environment [173]. However, both of the above studies were carried out in countries with a low prevalence of C. auris infections. One study from India, a country endemic for C. auris, involving a smaller number of patients at a trauma center in New Delhi, did not find C. auris in any newly admitted patient [52]. A more recent study has detected C. auris at a single site among 3 of 32 chronic respiratory disease patients who were screened at the time of admission to the Chest Diseases Hospital in Delhi, India (and remained colonized at discharge 10–17 days later), and another 9 patients were colonized during their stay in the hospital [79]. Many patients had a history of repeated hospitalization. The study also showed that fomite samples yielded C. auris from rooms where colonized patients were admitted nearly 9 days later [79]. C. auris has also been frequently isolated from high-touch surfaces, sink drains, and other items from patient’s rooms in centers experiencing C. auris outbreaks in the USA, Oman, and Kuwait [56–58,69]. Although the previous hospitalization records of the three patients colonized with C. auris at the time of admission in the recent Indian study were not reported, it is likely thatMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                            14 of 25NANA they were previously exposed to the hospital environment based on the chronic nature of their illness [79]. One study has reported isolation of C. auris from the community (swimming pools) in the Netherlands [174]. However, the possibility that the swimming pools were seeded by shedding from individuals who were previously colonized by C. auris during their stay in a healthcare or long-term care facility cannot be ruled out. However, contrary to previous efforts, Arora et al. [117] recently succeeded in the isolation of C. auris from two environmental sources, the salt marsh area and sandy beaches from Andaman Islands, Union Territory of India, in the Indian Ocean. The findings suggest hot tropical marine ecosystem as one of the natural habitat for C. auris. More importantly, the investigators isolated two different strains from a site remote from human activity (the salt marsh area); a multidrug-susceptible and a multidrug-resistant C. auris and the multidrug-susceptible isolate grew slower than other isolates at both 37 ◦ C and 42 ◦ C [117]. These findings are consistent with global warming emergence hypothesis put forth recently by Casadevall et al. [116,119], suggesting that C. auris likely evolved and adapted to higher temperatures recently.6.3. Transmission-Based Precautions The shedding of C. auris from colonized patients and its transmissibility to other patients in critical care settings within hospitals has been fairly established, and the trans- mission is facilitated largely due to this organism’s ability to persist in a viable form in the environment around the patient [38,41,48,58,79–81]. Viable C. auris cells have also been recovered from various environmental sources within the patient’s room/bathroom including beds, bedding materials (mattresses, pillows and bed sheets), bed side trolley, floors, sinks, bathroom door and faucet handles, bathroom walls, medical equipment and disposable/reusable equipment such as oxygen mask, axillary temperature probes and intravenous pole as well as personal mobile phones [48,58,68,69,79]. Cloth lanyards were also found as a source of intermittent transmission of C. auris in an ICU in one recent study [80]. C. auris has also been shown to survive for weeks on different moist and dry abiotic surfaces such as plastic and steel [68,127,175]. In a recent study, the environmental samples containing C. auris colonized patients yielded the organism nearly 7–14 days after colonization was detected [79]. The data are consistent with earlier findings which showed higher rates of C. auris colonization in long-term care facilities and co-located hospital and long-term care facilities [81]. In an earlier study, C. auris was isolated from the nares of a nurse who provided care to a heavily colonized patient during an outbreak in the United Kingdom [48], and from the hands of two healthcare workers and the groin of another healthcare worker during outbreak investigation in Colombia [176]. Thus, hospitalized and colonized patients, healthcare workers, and contaminated materials could serve as the source for the acquisition of C. auris by other hospitalized patients [48,58,68,75,79]. Previous studies have shown that colonization can occur in new patients with a minimum contact time of just 4 h and invasive infections have been acquired by susceptible patients within 48 h of admission to intensive care settings [48,79,177]. Thus, efforts should be made to minimize transmission of C. auris to other patients. All C. auris-colonized or -infected patients should preferably be placed in a single occupancy room with negative pressure and ensuite bathroom facilities, particularly for those patients with uncontained secretions or diarrhea. Multiple patients colonized or infected with C. auris may also be cohorted with other C. auris patients, if single rooms are not available [44,48,77,164–166]. The rooms housing C. auris patients should be clearly flagged to alert healthcare workers and visitors for special precautions and disposable biochemical products and equipment should preferably be used [44,77,164–166]. C. auris patients should be followed until discharge from the facility and also subsequently for at least one year after they have turned culture-negative during regular screening [77,78]. New patients (with a history of previous stay in a facility known to have C. auris cases or colonized patients) should be screened for high-yielding (axilla and groin) and other relevant (urine, throat, wounds, catheter) sites if they are likely to be colonized [77–79,175,178,179].Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                           15 of 25NANA 6.4. Standard Contact Precautions Once a C. auris case or colonized patient has been detected, it should be immediately reported to the infection control department of the healthcare facility and good standard infection control measures should be immediately instituted [38,77,78,164–166]. Patient movement should be allowed only for necessary medical procedures, a minimum number of dedicated healthcare staff should be designated for their care, and the cohorting of staff should be considered for multiple C. auris patients [77,78,178,179]. They should be scheduled as the last person for the day on the list for imaging, other procedures or surgery which should be followed by thorough cleaning of the environment. Strict compliance with good hand hygiene before and after touching C. auris patients or their surround- ings or during medical procedures is essential to prevent transmission of C. auris to new patients. Hand washing with soap and water followed by alcohol-based or chlorhexidine- based hand rub has been shown to be effective in eliminating C. auris from the hands of healthcare workers [31,180–182]. Adequate personal protective equipment (gloves and a long-sleeved gown) must be worn in all contacts with C. auris patients or their environment and wearing of a face mask may also be helpful in preventing the colonization of healthcare personnel [48,77,164–166].6.5. Environmental and Reusable Equipment Cleaning The decontamination of the room environment, particularly high-touch areas and medical equipment used in various procedures on C. auris patients, is extremely important to prevent further transmission. Although quaternary ammonium compounds (such as hexadecyltrimethylammonium or cetrimide, chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, etc.) are the most commonly used disinfectants in healthcare settings, they have limited activity against C. auris [180,182,183]. The twice daily (or three times daily during outbreaks) disinfection of the room environment and high-touch areas in rooms housing C. auris patients with active biocides has been shown to be highly effective in controlling further transmission [77,78]. Chlorhexidine shows formulation-dependent efficacy, with one study showing significant killing of C. auris cells by chlorhexidine in 70% isopropanol [181]. Sodium hypochlorite at 1000 parts per million (ppm) or higher has been shown to be effective in eradicating C. auris during environmental decontamination after patient discharge, though toxicity is a major issue at higher concentrations [42,180,182,183]. How- ever, sodium hypochlorite was effective at higher pH (pH = 11.31) but not at lower pH (pH = 8.68) against dry biofilms containing C. auris [127]. Peracetic acid (3500 ppm) and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (1000 ppm) are also effective against dry biofilms containing C. auris [127]. Hydrogen peroxide (<1%) or vaporized hydrogen peroxide and povidone- iodine, an antiseptic commonly used for skin disinfection before and after surgery, are also effective [70,183–185]. Peracetic acid (3500 ppm, pH 8.82) and sodium hypochlorite (1000 ppm, pH 13.13) have also been shown to be effective in preventing the transfer of C. auris after wiping with the disinfectants, while peracetic acid also prevented the regrowth of C. auris [127]. Silver nanoparticles (1 to 3 nm in diameter) have recently been shown to be highly effective in a dose-dependent manner against C. auris on medical and environmental surfaces, exerting a potent inhibitory activity both on biofilm formation and against preformed biofilms by causing cell wall damage [186]. For small spills, 70% ethyl alcohol is suitable and other products containing ethyl alcohol or phenols may also be effective [70,127,183,184]. Other methods, such as ultraviolet disinfection with proper exposure time, may also be used as an additional safety measure [183,187]. Ready-to-use cleaners and wipes based on hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite and seven other CDC-approved disinfectants have been shown to be effective against C. auris [78]. Terminal cleaning and disinfection of the environment are mandatory when C. auris infected or colo- nized patients are moved from the care area permanently by chemical fogging, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, ozone, chlorine dioxide, ultraviolet light, or titanium dioxide to ensure the disinfection of difficult-to-reach places in patient’s rooms [77,78].Microorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                                            16 of 25NANA Reusable equipment serves as a source of outbreaks of C. auris infection in healthcare facilities [75,77]. If possible, dedicated or single-use devices and equipment should be used for patients infected or colonized with C. auris. However, if this is not feasible, equipment and devices should be thoroughly disinfected after every use according to the manufacturer’s instructions and by following the material’s compatibility with the disinfecting agents [75,77,78]. Cleaning procedures should be audited to ensure that re- usable equipment are being disinfected adequately. Equipment and other materials which cannot be disinfected should not be used [75,77,78]. On-site training and auditing to the increase awareness of healthcare workers in infection prevention and control measures with special focus on personal protective equipment and environmental cleaning is also critical to contain C. auris [77,78]. Controlling C. auris outbreaks in healthcare facilities has proven to be an expensive affair. The total cost of resources to control a C. auris outbreak was determined in one study from the United Kingdom. The authors reported that the outbreak control cost exceeded £1 million, and £58,000 was spent every month during the subsequent year [188].6.6. Suppression and Decolonization Procedures for C. auris There are yet no established protocols for the decolonization of C. auris-positive pa- tients. Adherence to central and peripheral catheter care bundles, urinary catheter care bundle and adequate care of tracheostomy site have been advocated to reduce the rate of colonization. Twice daily skin decontamination with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate single- use wash cloths or 4% chlorhexidine solution have been tried in critically ill patients with limited success [48]. Mouth washing with 0.2% chlorhexidine has also been used with patients on ventilator support to reduce oropharyngeal colonization while chlorhexidine impregnated protective disks have been used for central vascular catheter exit sites to reduce line-associated seeding of bloodstream with C. auris [48]. However, C. auris colo- nization and further transmission continued to occur in the healthcare facility experiencing the outbreak [48]. Chlorhexidine at standard concentrations with/without alcohol used for skin, and wound cleansing and disinfection and octenidine dihydrochloride are effective only against planktonic C. auris populations and not against C. auris biofilms [87,181,189]. It has also been suggested that bathing with chlorhexidine may dry the skin which may prolong colonization with C. auris [77]. Even if transient decolonization is achieved, recolonization from polyester bedding material on which C. auris can survive for several days may lead to persistent colonization in some patients [77,180]. One recent study reported clearance of C. auris in 3 of 12 colonized patients (hospitalized for 33–150 days) before their dis- charge from the hospital; however, the strategies adopted for decolonization were not described [79].7. Treatment of C. auris Infections As stated above, C. auris isolates exhibit clade specific resistance to fluconazole, with most Clade I isolates exhibiting high-level of resistance [41,56–58,71,89]. Globally, >90% of C. auris isolates are resistant to fluconazole, and resistance to amphotericin B can also be >30% in some settings [71,73,89,190]. Consequently, the treatment choices for C. auris infections are limited and should be guided by antifungal susceptibility testing results, as resistance rates to amphotericin B and echinocandins also vary in different geographic regions. According to CDC guidelines, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is highly recommended when caring for patients with C. auris infection [191]. Echinocandins are recommended as initial therapy for the treatment of invasive C. auris infections, which are in line with the general guidelines developed by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for the management of candidiasis caused by Candida species showing reduced susceptibility to fluconazole [5,191]. The treatment may be changed after 5–7 days from echinocandin to fluconazole if C. auris isolate is susceptible to this drug and the patient is stable [5]. However, treatment failures are common and are usually attributedMicroorganisms 2021, 9, 807                                       "
"Candida study.pdf","    Global epidemiology of emerging Candida auris Johanna Rhodes and Matthew C Fisher  The discovery in 2009 of a new species of yeast, Candida auris, heralded the arrival of a novel emerging human infectious disease. This review highlights the unique characteristics of C. auris that have lled to it being of public health concern worldwide, namely public health concern, namely its global emergence, its ability to cause nosocomial outbreaks in healthcare settings, its innate and emerging resistance to multiple antifungal drugs and its resilience in the face of hygiene and infection control measures. Genomic epidemiology has identified four emergences of C. auris marked by four clades of the pathogen. These clades of C. auris are genetically dissimilar and are associated with differential resistance to antifungal drugs, suggesting that they will continue to phenotypically diverge into the future. The global emergence of C. auris testifies to the unmapped nature of Kingdom Fungi, and represents a new nosocomial threat that will require enhanced infection control across diverse healthcare and community settings.

Introduction Since its discovery in 2009 [1], Candida auris has been identified in more than 30 countries on six continents [2]. A retrospective SENTRY review identified a 2008 isolation from Pakistan; however, C. auris is gen- erally considered rare before 2009 suggesting that it represents a newly emerging human infection. In con- trast to other Candida species, C. auris spreads easily in health-care setting causing nosocomial outbreaks [3,4]. This fungus’ ability to persist, both on the human host and also on inanimate surfaces, has been well docu- mented [5,6] and is likely a key trait explaining its emergence. Exhibiting intrinsic resistance to flucona- zole [7] and variable susceptibility to other azole  Current Opinion in Microbiology 2019, 52:84–89  Available online at www.sciencedirect.comScienceDirectNANA antifungal drugs, 5-flucytosine [8], amphotericin B [9], and echinocandins [8,10,11], C. auris has been widely acknowledged as multi-drug resistant (MDR) [12,13]. This, along with its ability to persist and easily transmit, alongside its highly proliferative clonal life- history, has led to C. auris’ pandemic potential by causing an expanding range of nosocomial infections worldwide [1,3,7,14–18].Emergence of C. auris C. auris was first discovered and described in 2009 follow- ing isolation from discharge from the ear canal of a patient in Japan [1] and was taxonomically placed as a close relative to the Candida haemulonii complex. Since its discovery, C. auris has caused a ‘stealthy pandemic’, emerging across the globe (Figure 1) and is now recorded in all continents except Antarctica (Figure 2). However, C. auris is thought to have been misidentified as C. haemulonii on a number of occasions [4,13,19], suggest- ing that C. auris has likely been circulating as a human pathogen before 2009. The USA Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) queried the internationalsurveillance system SENTRY, and discovered four iso- lates from between 2009 and 2015 that were identified as C. haemulonii however were indeed C. auris [7]. A study from South Korea, which identified 15 isolates ofC. haemulonii in 2009 from the ear canals of patients with chronic otitis were later identified to be C. auris [20]. Inthe same year, the first cases of nosocomial infectioncaused by C. auris were also reported in South Korea;this study also queried the South Korean isolate collec- tion, and discovered the earliest isolate of C. auris was discovered in 1996 [15]. However, retrospective analysis of over 15 000 isolates from the SENTRY collection show no misidentifications before 2009 [7] and over5000 archived isolates from Taiwan before 2016 were negative, showing that the currently observed global distribution of C. auris is most likely explained by a process of rapid spatial emergence from a small number of foci. This observation is confirmed by ongoing genomic epidemiology showing multiple contemporary introduc- tions and ongoing transmission in the USA as well as other global settings [2].Genomic epidemiology Investigation into the C. auris genome has shown it to possess over 5000 protein coding genes [7,8,21], and expresses several virulence factors such as biofilm forma- tion and adherence [22,23], although to a lesser extent than C. albicans [22,24]. Muñoz et al. performed RNA-seq and discovered expansions of entire gene families were linked to drug resistance and virulence [21], which havewww.sciencedirect.comFigure 1                                Timeline showing the expanding worldwide detection of C. auris.     also been described in C. albicans [25]. Whilst the roles of specific genes were not characterised as part of the study, Muñoz et al. demonstrated that expansions of transporters and lipases within C. auris are a likely mechanism of virulence that is shared with other species of Candida yeasts [21].  Whilst initially thought to have high virulence, and exhi- biting crude mortality rates from C. auris-associated can- didaemia from between 33–72% [17,26,27], assessment from the UK Brompton outbreak showed no direct  www.sciencedirect.com  Global emergence of Candida auris Rhodes and Fisher 85NANANANA2004NANA 2009NANA 2013NANA 2015NANA 2017NACurrent Opinion in MicrobiologyNANANAassociation with mortality [3]. Currently, there is an urgent need to contextualise the virulence of C. auris against that observed from other candidaemia-causing yeasts such as C. albicans and Candida glabrata as there is much uncertainty surrounding the clinical con- sequences of detecting C. auris candidaemia.Genetic analysis using whole genome sequencing has revealed deep divergence within the C. auris species, with large variation between geographic clades separated by thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)Current Opinion in Microbiology 2019, 52:84–8986 Host–microbe interactions: fungi     Figure 2                                 (a) Global distribution of Candida auris clades (as of 28th February 2019) and (b) RAxML phylogeny showing the relationship amongst C. auris clades.    [2,7,8]. This divergence has led to the identification of four distinct geographic clades (I–IV), each with minimal genetic diversity within each clade: South Asian (clade I), South African (clade III), South American (clade IV) and East Asian (clade II; Figure 2). The East Asian clade (containing the type isolate of C. auris) appears to infect the ear only, whereas the other clades are known to cause invasive infections, nosocomial transmission and health- care outbreaks [28]. There appear to be specific drug resistance mutations in the ERG11 gene (encoding the target of azole antifungal drugs) that a strongly associated with resistance to azoles across the following geographic clades: F126T in South Africa, Y132F in South America, and Y132F or K143R in South Asia [2,7,8]. The appear- ance of the Y132F and K143R mutations has recently been shown to increase resistance to fluconazole in C. auris [29]. There appears to be no [antifungal-resis- tance mutation in ERG11 associated with the East Asian clade, which coincides with the higher rate of suscepti- bility observed in isolates from this clade. Clonal isolates from the South Asian clade have been identified at three hospitals located thousands of miles apart in India, confirming the nation-wide nature of transmission and potential for antifungal-resistance mutations to spread should they evolve [12]. Similarly, isolates from hospitals located approximately 700 km apart in Colombia were found to be genetically identical [30]. Isolates of similar genotypes have also been seen to cluster regionally within   Current Opinion in Microbiology 2019, 52:84–89NANANANA (a)NANA Clades South Asian (Clade I) East Asian (Clade II) South African (Clade III) South American (Clade IV) UnknownCreated with mapchart.net ©NANA (b)NANA 7,800 SNPsNACurrent Opinion in MicrobiologyNANANANA countries, usually around a hospital [2,31], marking local networks of transmission.One such a cluster was observed in the UK in 2015. An initial case of C. auris was reported in the Royal Brompton Hospital, a specialist cardio-thoracic centre in London, in April 2015 in a 20 bed mixed adult intensive care unit (ICU) [3]. The following week, a patient in the adjacent bed to the index case was identified as C. auris culture positive from a sputum sample, and they subsequently developed an intravascular line infection. Formal out- break measures were introduced in November 2015 when nine cases were identified, some with candidaemia. The number of cases within the Royal Brompton Hospital rose rapidly at the start of 2016. As healthcare associated transmission was a possibility within the ICU, environ- mental sampling of areas surrounding colonised patients was carried out, which showed contamination with C. auris. It was also observed during the outbreak that once patients were skin colonised, daily washes with the recommended 2% chlorhexidine wash cloth did not eradi- ate C. auris [5]. Therefore, due to the uncertainty over the time and source of the introduction of C. auris into the hospital, rapid development of molecular epidemiological tools was required. The handheld MinION nanopore sequencing device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK (ONT) and Illumina was used to whole genome sequence (WGS) multiple isolates with a diverseNA www.sciencedirect.comtemporal range over the outbreak to describe the genetic epidemiology of the outbreak, both within the hospital and in the global context. Temporal analysis of the sequences placed the introduction of C. auris into the hospital as March 2015, one month before the index case, and placed the outbreak globally within the South Asian clade [8]. Similar patterns of introduction and local spread have recently been described in other settings, notably the USA, where isolates from all known lineages of C. auris have been reported (Figure 2), and including a number of cases where patients are thought to have acquired infections from exposures in other countries [2].  Antifungal resistance and transmission in C. auris Currently, candidaemia infections caused by C. albicans are widely managed via the use of echinocandin therapy, and in some cases in combination with amphotericin B [17,32]. Intravenous amphotericin B not in combination with another drug has resulted in treatment failure [15]; however, the mechanistic nature of this resistance is not yet understood. Whilst there are currently no established breakpoints for antifungal susceptibility in C. auris, it is generally accepted that most isolates are multi-drug resis- tant, based on applying C. albicans breakpoints (both CLSI and EUCAST) [33].  Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole, which displays high MICs in many cases (>64 mg/l) have been seen in over 90% of cases [3,7,34], and reduced susceptibility to voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and isavuco- nazole have also been demonstrated [3,8,12]. Varying susceptibility to amphotericin B has also been shown [7,11,16,17,34,35], with Escandon et al. presenting four novel non-synonymous mutations that may be associated with resistance [30]. However, Muñoz et al. demonstrated that there was a transcriptional response to voriconazole and amphotericin B, with a small number of differentially expressed genes post-exposure to both drugs, suggesting that the mechanism of resistance to these drugs may be epigenetic rather than mutation-based [21]. Data on susceptibility to 5-flucytosine (5FC) are limited, but reports from India and the UK have shown raised MICs [3,7,8,36]. Because of the varying susceptibility of C. auris to azoles and amphotericin B, public health recommendations have led to the use of echinocandins as front-line therapy for infections [27,37]. Despite this, however, reduced susceptibility to echinocandins associ- ated with polymorphisms in the FKS1 gene has been identified [8,10,11] suggesting that, here too, antifungal resistance has evolved and may be of clinical significance. In a small percentage of cases, elevated MIC’s were found against all of the three major classes of antifungals. Increasing the copy numbers of ERG11 has recently been suggested as a mechanism of drug resistance in C. auris [21], similar to that seen in C. albicans [38] and Cryptococcus neoformans [39]. Clearly, the ongoing evolution of C. auris  www.sciencedirect.com  Global emergence of Candida auris Rhodes and Fisher 87NANA in the face of antifungal therapies needs to be closely monitored.Following the ‘Brompton experience’, guidelines from Public Health England report that colonisation by C. auris is highly persistent and is difficult to eradicate [40]. Specifically, reusable items of medical equipment, spe- cifically axillary skin-surface temperature probes, are known to be predictors of colonisation by C. auris [41]. Withdrawal of temperature probes following an outbreak in an Oxford (UK) hospital was shown to reduce the incidence of infection [41]. Further, daily skin decolo- nisation of patients with 2% aqueous chlorhexidine wipes was shown to be effective during an outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in Spain [32]. Overall, experience in attempting to contain the emergence of C. auris is show- ing that a one-size-fits-all approach to Candida infection control cannot be assumed.Future directions Currently, nothing is known about the origins and initial emergence of C. auris; its propensity to survive on inani- mate objects within the hospital alongside resistance to disinfection protocols suggests the existence of an unknown non-human environmental reservoir. However, similar to other Candida species, the true nature of C. auris’ ancestral reservoirs currently remains elusive [42–44]. The detection of clonal C. auris isolates on multiple continents simultaneously with distinct geographical antifungal resis- tance mechanisms suggests at least four independent emer- gence events followed by clonal expansion and the ongoing evolution of resistance in response to antifungal therapy [8]. Recent comparative genomic analysis has shown that most of the Candida mating and meiosis genes are present, and that each of the C. auris clades are fixed for either the MTLa or MTL a mating loci as follows: South Asian clade I, MTLa; South African clade III, MTLa; South American clade IV, MTLa; and East Asian clade II, MTLa [21]. These findings suggest that recombination is possible if clades of opposite mating types encounter one another. A recent study confirmed that C. auris is capable of efficient recom- bination [45]; such mating, if it occurs, could lead to the spectre of more complex genotypic and phenotypic diver- sity evolving in the future with potentially novel antifungal and virulence characteristics.Given the difficulties in identifying C. auris, there is a need for not only species level identification, but also clade-specific identification if the antifungal resistance characteristics of the clades continue to diverge [46]. There is a need to develop global surveillance tools, similar to those seen in the Ebola and Zika outbreak response [47], not only for C. auris, but for other human emerging fungal pathogens, such as Rasamsonia and Exophiala species. These surveillance tools need to be open access, web-based, and be available to all parts of the globe, especially in places where there is limited fundingCurrent Opinion in Microbiology 2019, 52:84–8988 Host–microbe interactions: fungi     for healthcare. These tools should be able to differentiate  between the geographic clades; standard molecular typ- ing techniques have proven unsuccessful or incomparable between laboratories. It is essential that these tools also rapidly identify C. auris; the use of the WGS and the  MinION sequencer sequencer from ONT has demon- strated that outbreak-specific references can be generated rapidly for the use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) changes and phylogenetic analyses [8,41]. As  sequencing technology develops, it is likely rapid sequencing of C. auris isolates can be achieved in 48 hours  or less leading to the potential for bedside diagnostics twinned with molecular epidemiology of nosocomial pat-  terns of transmission. Currently, it is not often known when patients become colonised – whether from the  hospital environment or endogenous carriers [27] – and the extent of carriage in the community remains largely  unexamined. Therefore, epidemiological studies that incorporate WGS to investigate the genetic diversity of  environmental and clinical isolates are needed more widely. There is also a need for studies that examine  the genetic diversity of clinical isolates from multiple body sites in patients. This is because the differential exposure to antifungal drugs for isolates from mucosal  sites versus systemic infections is likely to lead to the differential evolution of resistance, which may lead to  downstream clinical complications.   As echinocandins are the front-line therapy for C. auris infection treatment, new drugs may be needed to combat  high-grade echinocandin resistance if it evolves. New drug options, such as rezafungin (previously called  CD101), and the ß-glucan synthesis inhibitor SCY-078, have already shown promise [22,48]. More broadly, there  is a need for novel antifungal chemistries as the world- wide emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs con- tinues to challenge human health and food security [49].

The rapid spread of COVID-19 has attracted worldwide attention, and the World Health Organization (WHO)1, 3 has identified it as a public health emergency of international concern. The incubation period for this disease is generally 1−14 days.4 The disease usually begins with simple respiratory symptoms described as fever and cough for 2−3 days. Human challenge studies confirmed that COVID-19 causes upper respiratory disease and immune responses. Recent developments in RT-PCR for COVID-19 detection have given rise to a greater understanding of the clinical characteristics and molecular epidemiology of COVID-19.5 Since most of the patients with the earliest onset had been exposed to the south China seafood market in Wuhan, it was widely believed that COVID-19 originated from wild animals sold in the market. Shi et al6 reported that the natural host of COVID-19 might be bats; the team found that the full genome sequence of the COVID-19 obtained from the confirmed patient was 96% similar to the bat coronavirus, and it was also demonstrated that COVID-19 acts on the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 through the same cells as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS- CoV).

Meanwhile, the outbreak also drew attention and concern from the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is another human infectious disease caused by coronavirus. The transmission of COVID-19 is potent and the infection rate is fast. Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, the treatment is mainly symptomatic supportive therapy. In addition, it should be pointed out that patients with severe illness need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care. Recently, accurate RNA detection has been decisive for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiological studies that provide insight into the prevalence, seasonality, clinical manifestations and course of COVID-19 infection. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology and characteristics of COVID-19. Keywords: COVID-19 virus, Epidemiology, Review Cite this article as: Huang X, Wei F, Hu L, Wen L, Chen K. Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19. Arch Iran Med. 2020;23(4):268–271. doi: 10.34172/aim.2020.09.NANAcomplete yet. In this review, we review the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19.Virus Forms and Structure The coronavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus with a diameter of 80 ~120 nm. It consists of four types, namely α-CoV, β-CoV, δ-CoV and γ-CoV.7 Bats are the most important natural hosts. About 35% of the viruses they carry are coronaviruses, from which at least a dozen different coronaviruses have been identified so far.8 The COVID-19 was a novel class coronavirus with a circular or elliptic shape and a diameter of 60-140 nm.7-9 The typical coronavirus particle structure was observed under electron microscopy. Current studies have shown a 96.3% homology with the bat SARS-like coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13), suggesting that bats may be the natural host for COVID-19.Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics Methods of Detection Seropositive studies provide key insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19, but there are limitations including the limited ability to determine the time of infection. This makes it difficult to identify and count mild and asymptomatic infections.10Seroepidemiology Previous studies have shown that viral RNA can be found in the plasma or serum of patients with SARS-NANANAEpidemiological characteristics of COVID-19   COV, MERS-COV or SARS-COV-2 at different periods after the onset of disease.11 However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of viral RNA is not equivalent to detection of a complete infectious virus.12 As more and more asymptomatic infections are found in COVID-19 cases, blood safety should be considered. At the same time, current studies suggest that people are generally susceptible to COVID-19, and the severity of COVID-19 is positively correlated with age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.), which is similar to the situation with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) infection. To sum up, COVID-19 has strong transmission capacity and a large base of susceptible population. So, it is necessary to take actions as soon as possible to avoid larger scale spread. The final cause of death for many patients may be acute respiratory distress syndrome, according to the chief export of the acute respiratory care department at Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan university.3 For COVID-19, people of all ages, with or without immunity, may progress to the critical stage of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Admittedly, the mechanics of ARDS are unclear. Since there is no specific drug for COVID-19, treatment is concentrated on symptomatic support. In addition, it is important to emphasize that severe patients need more aggressive treatment and meticulous care.  COVID-19 in Adults At the same time, current studies suggest that the population is generally susceptible to COVID-19, and the severity of the disease is positively correlated with age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) This is similar to what happened with SARS and MERS. Huang et al1 reported the first 41 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Wuhan, among which 27 cases (66%) had a history of exposure to the seafood market in southern China, and one case had familial clustering. This report first mentioned that COVID-19 may have human- to-human transmission characteristics. Subsequently, Chen et al12 observed 99 patients with COVID-19 in the same hospital, and found that elderly men with close contacts and underlying diseases were more likely to be infected, which could rapidly progress to severe respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even become life-threatening.  COVID-19 in Children A number of studies have focused on pediatric populations. As children’s immune function is not mature, they are susceptible to respiratory system infections, and their symptoms are more diversified, so the formation of antibodies and cross-immunity and other problems is easy to be missed. With the spread of the epidemic, the number of children gradually increased. The infection affected premature infants and infants, and now there are severeNAcases of children.14 At present, most of the confirmed cases of children are declared to be cluster disease, i.e. “second- generation” infection, and no clear reports of children as the source of adult infection have been found. Beijing, Guangdong and other places have seen a number of cases of children infected with the new coronavirus, especially on January 26, 2020, when a 9-month-old infant in Beijing was infected through close family contact.14 The transmission route in children is, similar to adults, mainly by contact and respiratory droplets. Finding that most of the infected children have aggregation, aerogel transmission may also play a significant role in transmission. Careful monitoring of the developmental stages of mothers who become pregnant due to COVID-19 infection is needed, as adverse maternal and child outcomes of COVID-19 pregnancies persist, and public health system surveillance of the impact on infants and children is critical.Seasonality Although outbreaks and familial sexual transmission cases have been described, little is known about the seasonality of COVID-19.15 The scientists report that the new coronavirus is most likely to become a seasonal respiratory disease based on its current infectivity and lethality. McGraw, a professor of infectious diseases at Penn state university, believes that COVID-19 is more seasonal.16 It becomes more active in winter, when it enters people’s bodies by droplets, and it spreads faster in cold and dry air. Normal seasonal viruses usually cannot withstand high temperatures, so once summer arrives, the virus has basically zero infectivity when taken. On the other hand, infectious disease expert Amesh Adalja disagrees with McGraw, arguing that the evidence suggests it is not seasonal because we have not seen the time of spring and summer, and although its symptoms are somewhat similar to seasonal flu that does not mean that it is really a seasonal virus. Admittedly, the seasons can affect it, but they do not necessarily make it disappear. As we all know, our country is in the northern hemisphere; spring temperatures are mild, which helps spread virus. However, there have also been confirmed cases across the ocean in the southern hemisphere, suggesting that the virus is resistant. However, as the seasons change, it is possible that the epidemic situation in China may weaken and the crisis in the countries of the southern hemisphere may intensify, although we do not know yet. Therefore, it is too early to say whether the new coronavirus is seasonal. We do not know much about it, there is no data to carry out a comprehensive analysis, and everything should be rigorous.Clinical Characteristics COVID-19 is usually associated with respiratory disease.

Internationally,  the number of confirmed reports continue to rise.25 At present, China has listed COVID-19 as a class b infectious disease stipulated by the law on prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, and adopted an infectious  disease prevention. The basic strategy for controlling the epidemic is early detection, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment. COVID-19 cases are insidious and transmissible in the incubation period, and multiple  clusters have been reported in China. The causal role of  COVID-19 in these cases is therefore uncertain and larger studies are needed in the future to describe the prevalence, clinical characteristics and course of the disease.26   Authors’ Contribution  All authors contributed significantly to both the study and the    270NANAStudyLocation Guangxi, 11−68 China Guangzhou, 33−62 China Wuhan, 26−79 China Shenzhen, 10−72 China Beijing, 1−94 China Wuhan, 42−68 China Wuhan, 43−66 China Zhejiang, 32−52 China Wuhan, 21−82 China Wuhan,ChinaNANA manuscript.

Realizing that solar      BioMed CentralNAOpen AccessNANANANANANANAReceived: 9 February 2008 Accepted: 25 February 2008 doi:10.1186/1743-422X-5-29NANANANA Abstract The epidemiology of influenza swarms with incongruities, incongruities exhaustively detailed by the late British epidemiologist, Edgar Hope-Simpson. He was the first to propose a parsimonious theory explaining why influenza is, as Gregg said, ""seemingly unmindful of traditional infectious disease behavioral patterns."" Recent discoveries indicate vitamin D upregulates the endogenous antibiotics of innate immunity and suggest that the incongruities explored by Hope-Simpson may be secondary to the epidemiology of vitamin D deficiency. We identify – and attempt to explain – nine influenza conundrums: (1) Why is influenza both seasonal and ubiquitous and where is the virus between epidemics? (2) Why are the epidemics so explosive? (3) Why do they end so abruptly? (4) What explains the frequent coincidental timing of epidemics in countries of similar latitude? (5) Why is the serial interval obscure? (6) Why is the secondary attack rate so low? (7) Why did epidemics in previous ages spread so rapidly, despite the lack of modern transport? (8) Why does experimental inoculation of seronegative humans fail to cause illness in all the volunteers? (9) Why has influenza mortality of the aged not declined as their vaccination rates increased? We review recent discoveries about vitamin D's effects on innate immunity, human studies attempting sick-to-well transmission, naturalistic reports of human transmission, studies of serial interval, secondary attack rates, and relevant animal studies. We hypothesize that two factors explain the nine conundrums: vitamin D's seasonal and population effects on innate immunity, and the presence of a subpopulation of ""good infectors."" If true, our revision of Edgar Hope-Simpson's theory has profound implications for the prevention of influenza.NANA radiation has profound effects on influenza, he added an unidentified ""seasonal stimulus"" to the heart of his radical epidemiological model [1]. Unfortunately, the mecha- nism of action of the ""seasonal stimulus"" eluded him in life and his theory languished. Nevertheless, he parsimo- niously used latent asymptomatic infectors and an uni-NA Page 1 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)Virology Journal 2008, 5:29    dentified ""season stimulus"" to fully or partially explain seven epidemiological conundrums [2].  1. Why is influenza both seasonal and ubiquitous and where is the virus between epidemics?  2. Why are the epidemics so explosive?  3. Why do epidemics end so abruptly?  4. What explains the frequent coincidental timing of epi- demics in countries of similar latitudes?  5. Why is the serial interval obscure?  6. Why is the secondary attack rate so low?  7. Why did epidemics in previous ages spread so rapidly, despite the lack of modern transport?  An eighth conundrum – one not addressed by Hope- Simpson – is the surprising percentage of seronegative volunteers who either escape infection or develop only minor illness after being experimentally inoculated with a novel influenza virus. The percentage of subjects sickened by iatrogenic aerosol inoculation of influenza virus is less than 50% [3], although such experiments depend on the dose of virus used. Only three of eight subjects without pre-existing antibodies developed illness after aerosol inhalation of A2/Bethesda/10/63 [4]. Intranasal adminis- tration of various wild viruses to sero-negative volunteers only resulted in constitutional symptoms 60% of the time; inoculation with Fort Dix Swine virus (H1N1) – a virus thought to be similar to the 1918 virus – in six sero- negative volunteers failed to produce any serious illness, with one volunteer suffering moderate illness, three mild, one very mild, and one no illness at all [5]. Similar studies by Beare et al on other H1N1 viruses found 46 of 55 directly inoculated volunteers failed to develop constitu- tional symptoms [6]. If influenza is highly infectious, why doesn't direct inoculation of a novel virus cause universal illness in seronegative volunteers?  A ninth conundrum evident only recently is that epidemi- ological studies question vaccine effectiveness, contrary to randomized controlled trials, which show vaccines to be effective. For example, influenza mortality and hospitali- zation rates for older Americans significantly increased in the 80's and 90's, during the same time that influenza vac- cination rates for elderly Americans dramatically increased [7,8]. Even when aging of the population is accounted for, death rates of the most immunized age group did not decline [9]. Rizzo et al studying Italian eld- erly, concluded, ""We found no evidence of reduction in influenza-related mortality in the last 15 years, despite the      http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29NAconcomitant increase of influenza vaccination coverage from ~10% to ~60%"" [10]. Given that influenza vaccina- tions increase adaptive immunity, why don't epidemio- logical studies show increasing vaccination rates are translating into decreasing illness?After confronting influenza's conundrums, Hope-Simp- son concluded that the epidemiology of influenza was not consistent with a highly infectious disease sustained by an endless chain of sick-to-well transmissions [2]. Two of the three most recent reviews about the epidemiology of influenza state it is ""generally accepted"" that influenza is highly infectious and repeatedly transmitted from the sick to the well, but none give references documenting such transmission [11-13]. Gregg, in an earlier review, also reit- erated this ""generally accepted"" theory but warned:""Some fundamental aspects of the epidemiology of influenza remain obscure and controversial. Such broad questions as what specific forces direct the appearance and disappearance of epidemics still chal- lenge virologists and epidemiologists alike. Moreover, at the most basic community, school, or family levels of observation, even the simple dynamics of virus introduction, appearance, dissemination, and particu- larly transmission vary from epidemic to epidemic, locale to locale, seemingly unmindful of traditional infectious disease behavioral patterns."" [14] (p. 46)Questioning a generally accepted assumption means ask- ing anew, ""What does the evidence actually show? Thus, we asked, are there any controlled human studies that attempted sick-to-well influenza transmission? Do natu- ralistic studies of outbreaks in confined spaces prove sick- to-well transmission or are they compatible with another mode of dissemination? Is there an easily measurable serial interval (the median time between the index case and the secondary cases), so crucial to establishing sick-to- well transmission? Are measured secondary attack rates in families (the percentage of family members sickened after a primary case) suggestive of a highly infectious virus? What do animal models of influenza tell us?Do current theories explain the explosive onset and then abrupt disappearance of epidemics, epidemics that cease despite a wealth of potential victims lacking adaptive immunity [15]? Why have epidemic patterns in Great Brit- ain not altered in four centuries, centuries that have seen great increases in the speed of human transport [16]? If each successive epidemic increases herd immunity and children born since the last epidemic are non-immune, why doesn't the average age of persons infected in succes- sive epidemics become progressively lower[17]? Why did the peak of 25 consecutive epidemics in France and the USA occur within a mean of four days of each other [18]?NA Page 2 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)Virology Journal 2008, 5:29    Review of Jordan's sobering monograph of the 1918 pan- demic leaves little room to doubt that close human inter- action propagates influenza [19]. Furthermore, laboratory evidence leaves no doubt that droplets or aerosols can transmit influenza; droplets containing a high dose of virus, or aerosols containing a much lower dose, both can result in iatrogenic human infection [20].  Subjects that sicken do so two to four days after being iatrogenically infected; that is, the incubation period is about three days. However, it is crucial to remember that the incubation period only tells us what the serial interval should be, not what it is. Furthermore, induction of human infection in the laboratory only tells us such infection is possible; it does not tell us who is infecting the well in nature.  The obvious candidate is the sick. However, Edgar Hope- Simpson contended that the extant literature on serial interval, secondary attack rates, and other epidemiologi- cal aspects of influenza are not compatible with sick-to- well transmission as the usual mode of contagion. In his 1992 book, after considering all known epidemiological factors, he presented a comprehensive, parsimonious – and radically different – model for the transmission of influenza, one heavily dependent on a profound, even controlling, effect of solar radiation. Furthermore, while agreeing the sick could infect the well, Hope-Simpson's principal hypothesis was that epidemic influenza often propagates itself by a series of transmissions from a small number of highly infectious – but generally symptomless – latent carriers, briefly called into contagiousness by the ""seasonal stimulus.""     In contrast, Kilbourne's 1987 text – without mentioning serial interval or secondary attack rates in his chapter on epidemiology – concluded, ""Any doubt about the com-   municability of influenza from those ill with the disease is  dispelled by studies in crowded, confined, or isolated  populations"" [21]. (p. 269) As discussed below, the natu- ralistic studies Kilbourne refers to certainly indicate  human interaction facilitates transmission of influenza.  However, these naturalistic studies simply assume that the  first person with identified illness is the index case. Obvi-                                          ously, A preceding B does not prove A causes B.                     Vitamin D, innate immunity, and influenza Hope-Simpson's model theorized that an unidentified  ""seasonal stimulus,"" inextricably bound to solar radia-  tion, substantially controlled the seasonality of influenza. Recent evidence suggests the ""seasonal stimulus"" may be seasonal impairments of the antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) systems crucial to innate immunity [22], impair- ments caused by dramatic seasonal fluctuations in 25- hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels [23]. (Figure 1) The evidence that vitamin D has profound effects on innate immunity is rapidly growing [24].     http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29NAIn fact, Aloia and Li-Ng presented evidence of a dramatic vitamin D preventative effect from a randomized control- led trial (RCT) [25]. In a post-hoc analysis of the side effect questions of their original three-year RCT, they discovered 104 post-menopausal African American women given vitamin D were three times less likely to report cold and flu symptoms than 104 placebo controls. A low dose (800 IU/day) not only reduced reported incidence, it abolished the seasonality of reported colds and flu. A higher dose (2000 IU/day), given during the last year of their trial, vir- tually eradicated all reports of colds or flu. (Figure 2) Recent discoveries about vitamin D's mechanism of action in combating infections [26] led Science News to suggest that vitamin D is the ""antibiotic vitamin"" [27] due primarily to its robust effects on innate immunity.Unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity is that branch of host defense that is ""hard-wired"" to respond rapidly to microorganisms using genetically encoded effectors that are ready for activation by an antigen before the body has ever encountered that antigen. Activators include intact microbes, Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPS), and host cellular constituents released during tissue injury. Of the effectors, the best studied are the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [28].Both epithelial tissues and phagocytic blood cells produce AMPs; they exhibit rapid and broad-spectrum antimicro-3430NA 282420NA 16NA 1284NA 0SeptOctNovDecJanFebMarAprMayJuneJulyAugSeptOctNovDecJanFebMarNANAFigure Geometric 3723) birth tamin cohort D and mean at age 1[25)OH)D] monthly (light 45concentration variations shade, n = 3712)serum in(dark a 1958 25-hydroxyvi- British shade, Geometric mean monthly variations in serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D [25)OH)D] concentration in men (dark shade, n = 3723) and women (light shade, n =3712) in a 1958 British birth cohort at age 45. 25(OH)D levels are in ng/ml; to convert to nmol/L, multiply by 2.5.

In general, they act by rapidly and irreversibly damaging the lipoprotein membranes of microbial targets, including enveloped viruses, like influenza [30]. Other AMPs, such as human beta-defensin 3, inhibit influenza haemaggluti- nin A mediated fusion by binding to haemagglutinin A associated carbohydrates via a lectin-like interaction [31].  AMPs protect mucosal epithelial surfaces by creating a hostile antimicrobial shield. The epithelia secrete them constitutively into the thin layer of fluid that lies above the apical surface of the epithelium but below the viscous mucous layer. To effectively access the epithelium a microbe, such as influenza, must penetrate the mucous barrier and then survive damage inflicted by the AMPs present in the fluid that is in immediate contact with the epithelial surface. Should this constitutive barrier be breached, the binding of microbes to the epithelium and/ or local tissue injury rapidly provokes the expression of high concentrations of specific inducible AMPs such as human beta-defensin 2 and cathelicidin, that provide a ""back-up"" antimicrobial shield. These inducible AMPs also act as chemo-attractants for macrophages and neu- trophils that are present in the immediate vicinity of the site of the microbial breach [28-30]. In addition, catheli- cidin plays a role in epithelial repair by triggering epithe- lial growth and angiogenesis [32].  The crucial role of vitamin D in the innate immune system was discovered only very recently [33,34]. Both epithelial cells and macrophages increase expression of the antimi-      http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29NANAcrobial cathelicidin upon exposure to microbes, an expression that is dependent upon the presence of vita- min D. Pathogenic microbes, much like the commensals that inhabit the upper airway, stimulate the production of a hydroxylase that converts 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D, aseco-steroid hormone. This in turn rapidly activates a suite of genes involved in defense [35]. 0 Winter In the macrophage, the presence of vitamin D also Placebo appears to suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines,NA Interferon γ, TNFα, and IL12, and down regulate the cel- lular expression of several PAMP receptors. In the epider- mis, vitamin D induces additional PAMP receptors, enabling keratinocytes to recognize and respond to microbes [36]. Thus, vitamin D appears to both enhance the local capacity of the epithelium to produce endog- enous antibiotics and – at the same time – dampen certain arms of the adaptive immune response, especially those responsible for the signs and symptoms of acute inflam-mation, such as the cytokine storms operative when influ-enza kills quickly.Of particular note is that not all animals appear to depend on vitamin D for their innate immune circuitry. The cathe- licidin genes of mouse, rat, and dog, lack a vitamin D receptor-binding site, and do not require vitamin D for expression [34]. Therefore, one cannot extrapolate the role vitamin D plays in human infections from studies of such animals.Plasma levels of vitamin 25(OH)D in African Americans, known to be lower than white skinned individuals, are inadequate to fully stimulate the vitamin D dependent antimicrobial circuits operative within the innate immune system. However, the addition of 25(OH)D restored the dependent circuits and greatly enhanced expression of AMPs [37]. High concentrations of melanin in dark-skinned individuals shield the keratinocytes from the ultraviolet radiation required to generate vitamin D in skin [38]. In addition, the production of vitamin D in skin diminishes with aging [39]. Therefore, relative – but easily correctable – deficiencies in innate immunity probably exist in many dark-skinned and aged individuals, espe- cially during the winter.Because humans obtain most vitamin D from sun expo- sure and not from diet, a varying percentage of the popu- lation is vitamin D deficient, at any time, during any season, at any latitude, although the percentage is higher in the winter, in the aged, in the obese, in the sun- deprived, in the dark-skinned, and in more poleward pop- ulations [40,41]. However, seasonal variation of vitamin D levels even occur around the equator [42] and wide- spread vitamin D deficiency can occur at equatorial lati- tudes [43], probably due to sun avoidance [44], rainyNA Page 4 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)Virology Journal 2008, 5:29    seasons [45], and air pollution [46]. For example, a study of Hong Kong infants showed about half had 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/ml in the winter [47]. Even in the summer, few of the infants had levels higher than 30 ng/ ml, which many experts now think are below the lower limit of the optimal range [40,41,48,49]. As 25(OH)D levels affect innate immunity, then a varying percentage of most populations – even equatorial ones – will have impaired innate immunity at any given time, together with distinct seasonal variations in that percentage. The effects such impairments have on influenza transmission are unknown.  Human studies attempting sick-to-well human transmission In 2003, Bridges et al reviewed influenza transmission and found ""no human experimental studies published in the English-language literature delineating person-to-person transmission of influenza. This stands in contrast to sev- eral elegant human studies of rhinovirus and RSV trans- mission ..."" [50]. (p. 1097)  However, according to Jordan's frightening monograph on the 1918 pandemic, there were five attempts to dem- onstrate sick-to-well influenza transmission in the desper- ate days following the pandemic and all were ""singularly fruitless"" [19]. (p. 441) Jordan reports that all five studies failed to support sick-to-well transmission, in spite of hav- ing numerous acutely ill influenza patients, in various stages of their illness, carefully cough, spit, and breathe on a combined total of >150 well patients [51-55].  Rosenau's work was the largest of the studies, illustrative of the attempts, and remarkable for the courageousness of the volunteers [52]. In 1919 – in a series of experiments – he and six colleagues at the U.S. Public Health Service attempted to infect 100 ""volunteers obtained from the Navy."" He reports all volunteers were ""of the most suscep- tible age,"" and none reported influenza symptoms in 1918. That is, ""from the most careful histories that we could elicit, they gave no account of a febrile attack of any kind,"" during the previous year. The authors then selected influenza donors from patients in a ""distinct focus or out- break of influenza, sometimes an epidemic in a school with 100 cases, from which we would select typical cases, in order to prevent mistakes in diagnosis of influenza."" Rosenau made every attempt to get donors who were early in their illness, ""A few of the donors were in the first day of the disease. Others were in the second or third day of the disease.""           http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29NAtransferred this to our volunteers. We always obtained the material in the following way: The patients with fever, in bed, has a large, shallow, traylike arrange- ment before him or her, and we washed out one nos- tril with some sterile salt solution, using perhaps 5 c.c., which is allowed to run into this tray; and that nostril is blown vigorously into the tray. That is repeated with the other nostril. The patient then gargles the solution. Next we obtain some bronchial mucous through coughing, and then we swab the mucous surface of each nares and also the mucous membranes of the throat.""Then they mixed all the ""stuff"" together and sprayed 1 cc of the mixture in each of the nostrils of 10 volunteers, and ""into the throat, while inspiring, and on the eye"" and waited 10 days for the volunteers to fall ill. However, ""none of them took sick in any way."" Undaunted, Rosenau conducted another experiment in which ten acutely ill influenza patients coughed directly into the faces of each ten well volunteers. Again, ""none of them took sick in any way.""Perhaps Rosenau's and similar experiments failed because all the well volunteers had contracted infections in 1918 and were immune from further infection. While possible, none of the volunteers reported symptoms in 1918, even a fever. Furthermore, adaptive immunity to influenza is relative to the immune response that infection generates and to the time since infection; it is seldom absolute and abiding.Another explanation is that all of the influenza patients had passed their time of infectivity although Rosenau obtained donors in the first, second, or third day of their illnesses. As no laboratory confirmation was possible, per- haps the ill did not have influenza, but we doubt U.S. Public Health Service physicians had much trouble mak- ing accurate clinical diagnosis of influenza in 1919. Fur- thermore, all the donors were symptomatic; peak viral shedding occurs 24–72 hours after infection, and the amount of virus shed is associated with symptoms [56]. Perhaps peak viral shedding is not associated with peak infectivity. Perhaps – although Rosenau does not report the date or season of the experiments – all the naval vol- unteers had adequate innate immunity from sun expo- sure. Obviously, another explanation is that sick-to-well transmission is not the usual mode of contagion.Naturalistic reports of sick-to-well transmission A number of naturalistic studies suggest influenza is trans- ""Then we proceeded to transfer the virus obtained from cases of the disease; that is, we collected the material and mucous secretions of the mouth and nose and bronchi from (19) cases of the disease andNA Page 5 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)Virology Journal 2008, 5:29    well, and the airliner subsequently malfunctioned, caus- ing a four-hour delay in which passengers breathed re-cir- culated air [60].  Although her influenza culture was negative, the authors hypothesized their ""index case"" infected 37 well passen- gers within a mean of 38 hours after she boarded the plane. However, 30 other passengers boarded the Alaskan plane at the same time as the sick passenger, and other passengers were already onboard, any of whom could have been the common source. The airline study, like other naturalistic studies, is very suggestive of a common source and aerosol transmission, but offers no proof that the common source was the suspected index case, other than the logic that if A preceded B then A must have caused B.  Experts frequently cite an experience at an ""irradiated"" Livermore, California, VA hospital during the 1957–58 influenza epidemic as naturalistic evidence of sick-to-well aerosol influenza transmission. McLean (as part of a gen- eral discussion in a paper by Jordan) [61] reported an entire hospital building unit, housing approximately 150 patients with chronic pulmonary disease, was ""totally radiated"" in an attempt to reduce TB contagion through the air. There remained, nonradiated, another 250 control patients. He reported a two percent influenza attack rate for the ""radiated patients"" compared to a 19 percent attack rate for the ""nonradiated patients."" (p. 37).  However, Maclean's description of the Livermore hospi- tal's irradiation procedures is inadequate to know if patients were being directly irradiated, thus triggering vita- min D production in their skin. However, careful inspec- tion of another 1957 publication about a similarly irradiated Baltimore VA hospital – co-authored by McLean – is illuminating [62]. The Baltimore hospital wing apparently used a similar irradiation set-up with ""standard ultraviolet light fixtures."" (p. 421) Illustrations clearly show – despite text stating that only upper air was irradiated – that the rooms and hallways were all equipped with UV lights that either shone directly or indi- rectly on patients, apparently 24 hours per day, seven days a week (see pp. 422–423 for illustrations). If the irradia- tion processes were similar in Livermore and Baltimore hospitals, they would have significantly raised the 25(OH)D levels of the irradiated, and relatively influenza- free, patients.  Furthermore, if irradiation of the air destroyed viral aero- sols and was responsible for the lower attack rate, such results should be reproducible. In a carefully controlled trial, Gelperin et al directly investigated the possibility of transmission of viral respiratory illness by aerosols [63]. For four months during the height of the flu season, the      http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29NAauthors carefully irradiated only the upper air in half the classrooms in eight New Haven schools with ultraviolet light, and, unlike the Livermore VA hospital, the research- ers took great care not to irradiate the students, either directly or indirectly. When they compared absenteeism in irradiated classrooms to non-irradiated control schools, they found no effect from upper air irradiation. Two other large field studies in schools likewise showed no effect from UV air irradiation on viral diseases trans- mitted via the respiratory tract [64,65].These last three studies do not disprove aerosol transmis- sion. Such transmission could have occurred at lower room levels and the schoolchildren were free to contract infections outside of the classroom. However, one might have expected some decrease in infection rates. Further- more, their negative results stand in stark contrast to the dramatic effects seen in the irradiated patients in Liver- more, leading us conclude the irradiated Livermore patients were the beneficiaries of more than just cleaner air.What is the serial interval for influenza? The generally accepted theory of sick-to-well transmission demands direct epidemiological measurement (not calculation from the incubation period) of a serial interval between causal and resultant cases (time between successive cases in a chain of transmission) as has been amply demonstrated for other respi- ratory infectious diseases. In families, where the virus infects one member outside the home and that member then infects others inside the family, a serial interval should be easy to demonstrate if the virus is propagating itself via sick-to-well transmission. Unfortunately, when the World Health Organization Writing Group reported that ""the serial interval ... is 2 – 4 days"" (p. 83) for influenza, they failed to give a reference and apparently meant the incu- bation period is 2 – 4 days [56]. While the incubation period of influenza is well documented, if anyone has suc- cessfully documented a serial interval for influenza in families, we have yet to locate their work.In contrast, Hope-Simpson, using viral isolates obtained over 8 years, found low attack rates within households, a high proportion of affected households with only one influenza case (70%), and no demonstrable serial interval [66]. A five-year serological surveillance study found that 73% of family members who get influenza get it on the first day and are apparent index cases [67]. They could not identify a serial interval. Jordan et al followed 60 families during the Asian epidemic of 1957, isolating the virus from 86% of the families [68]. They found no evidence of a serial interval. Jordan later reviewed similar studies and reported, ""No peak occurred at the expected incubation period when secondary cases in families were plotted by intervals from the index case"" [61]. (p. 32).NA Page 6 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)Virology Journal 2008, 5:29    Viboud et al did not say so, but they apparently could not demonstrate a serial interval in families, as secondary cases did not peak at any particular interval after the first case in the family [69]. Remarkably, in 116 families, two family members developed symptoms simultaneously. Of the 131 family members who developed a flu-like illness within five days of the 543 serologically confirmed first cases, it appears that 38 of 131 occurred on day one, 40 on day two, 30 on day three, 28 on day four, and nine on day five.  If influenza is highly contagious, a serial interval should be evident – easily observed and directly measured – as sick family members infect the well. The large percentage of family members that sicken on the first day and the lack of a demonstrable serial interval, despite numerous attempts to measure one, seems more consistent with a limited number of infectors, usually outside the family, than with all the sick being infectors.  What is the secondary attack rate for influenza? The reproductive number, R0, an estimation of the average number of new cases of influenza produced by each infec- tious case in a fully susceptible population, has replaced secondary attack rates in most epidemiological models. However, the R0 for influenza has been ""notoriously hard to estimate"" [70] (p. 11146). While the estimated R0 remains obscure, epidemiologists have directly measured its father, secondary attack rates, for more than 5 decades. For a highly infectious virus, secondary attack rates for influenza are surprisingly low.  Secondary attack rates for influenza cannot be accurately determined without knowing the serial interval and are thus actually subsequent attack rates. Subsequent attack rates inflate the rate because they include all co-primary, tertiary, and later cases as secondaries. The subsequent attack rate for rhinovirus among non-immune family members is 58% [71]. The rate for unvaccinated house- hold contacts is 70% for measles [72] and 71% for vari- cella [73]. If influenza is highly contagious and spread by the sick, then secondary attack rates should reflect that contagiousness.  However, 80% of household members with an infected family member escaped the first outbreak of Hong Kong influenza in Great Britain despite it being a new antigenic variant in a non-immune population [74]. Thus, even if one assumes all subsequent cases were secondaries, the secondary attack rate was only 20%. Neuzil et al found that 22% of household members became ill within three days of a child in the family being absent from school due to illness but did not report how many family members became ill on the same day as the child [75]. Using a spe-       http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29NAcific clinical definition in secondary cases, Viboud et al found a subsequent attack rate of 18% [69].Longini et al analyzed data from four large family studies, reporting the apparent secondary attack rates varied from 13 to 30% [76]. After taking the community infection rate into account, they concluded the actual secondary attack rate among family members was 15%. Later, Longini et al estimated the secondary attack rate for adults and children with low levels of preexisting viral specific antibodies was 18 percent and 37%, respectively, while the secondary attack rate in adults and children with high levels of such antibodies was 1.6% and 3.4%, respectively [77].For a review of all studies on subsequent attack rates up to 1986, see Thacker [78]. Of the eight household studies he analyzed, four showed a subsequent attack rate in the teens (14%, 15%, 15%, 17%), two in the twenties (21% and 27%), one was 31%, while one was 58% (H3N2 in New Zealand in 1973). The weighted mean of subsequent attack rates in all 870 households was 22%.A recent review combining the data from four controlled household studies of antiviral effectiveness in the control households found a combined subsequent attack rate of 13% for symptomatic laboratory confirmed infections (136 of 1061 contacts) and 23% for any laboratory con- firmed infections (246 of 1061 contacts) [79].Such low subsequent attack rates in families seem incon- sistent with a highly infectious virus sustaining itself by sick-to-well transmission. They seem more consistent with large intrafamilial variations in immunity and family members contracting the infection, usually outside the home, from a common source.Animal studies Ironically, the strongest evidence for sick-to-well trans- mission in man comes from studies of ferrets. Unlike human studies, studies show infected ferrets readily trans- mit influenza to well animals and those newly sickened animals readily infect a third animal and so on [80]. Recently, similar experiments with guinea pigs were able to sustain a chain of eight successive transmissions but the animals do not become ill (written communication with Lowen A., Palese Laboratory). Likewise, hamsters can transmit influenza but apparently do not become ill [81]. Schulman and Kilbourne were able to infect about 50% of secondary mice after caging them with a two experimen- tally infected animals [82]. However, they were unable to get the newly sickened mice to transmit, that is, instigate a chain of transmission from sick to well mice.Schulman and Kilbourne did demonstrate that some infector mice are ""good transmitters"" while other miceNA Page 7 of 12 (page number not for citation purposes)Virology Journal 2008, 5:29    will not transmit the virus, it spite of inoculation with the same dose of virus. That is, for unknown reasons, some infected mice readily transmit the disease to their litterma- tes and some will not. As all infector mice received an identical inoculum of virus, it is reasonable to hypothe- size that good transmitters have an unidentified inade- quacy in innate immunity that facilitate their ability to transmit the virus.  It is worth noting that one animal study indicated vitamin D, when added to the diet of rats, prevented influenza but a subsequent paper reported it did not [83,84]. Young et al also reported that a Japanese researcher, Midzuno, was able to reproduce influenza in rats simply by maintaining them on diets deficient in vitamin D, apparently part of Japan's World War II biological weapons research. (The American CIA confiscated Midzuno's papers after the war.) As vitamin D does not upregulate AMPs in murine mammals, it is unclear what these studies mean. If researchers can identify an influenza susceptible species in which vitamin D increases expression of AMPs, it would be useful to know if vitamin D deficiency promotes the pathology of influenza.  Discussion After a 20 year search for parsimony, Hope-Simpson hypothesized that influenza is mainly transmitted by a limited number of highly infectious latent carriers – carri- ers infected the prior season – who are called into infectiv- ity by a ""seasonal stimulus"" inextricably bound to sunlight and who remain highly infective for brief peri- ods, thus explaining the waves of influenza that abruptly end despite a wealth of non-immune potential victims [2]. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, researchers have never demonstrated latency for influenza, as expected with a constantly replicating RNA virus.  However, significant seasonal and population variations in innate immunity make it unnecessary to postulate latency to explain the bizarre epidemiology of influenza. While any theory of influenza must take into account four factors: transmissibility, virulence, adaptive immunity, and innate immunity, it has been easy to ignore innate immunity as it lacked demonstrable seasonal variations, population variations, and a mechanism of action.  To make sense of influenza's epidemiology, we revise Hope-Simpson theory, hypothesizing marked variation in the infectivity of the infected (the good infectors demon- strated in rats by Schulman and Kilbourne in 1963) and that vitamin D deficiency is Hope-Simpson's seasonal stimulus. Adding these two factors to transmissibility, vir- ulence, and adaptive immunity, solves a number of influ- enza's mysteries.       http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29NA1. Why is influenza both seasonal and ubiquitous and where is the virus between epidemics?If influenza were surviving in an endless chain of transmissions from good transmitters to the well – the good transmitters being generally asymptomatic dur- ing times of enhanced innate immunity – the disease would be widely seeded in the population, explaining its ubiquity. Seasonal impairments in innate immu- nity would allow seasonal epidemics in temperate lat- itudes and less predictable epidemics in tropical zones, depending on viral novelty, transmissibility, virulence, and the innate immunity of the population. Non-seasonal isolated outbreaks would usually only appear in nursing homes [85] or prisons [86] where lack of sunlight impaired innate immunity; such iso- lated outbreaks would seldom lead to community out- breaks. More extensive out-of-season outbreaks, as occurred in 1918, would arise when novel antigenic viruses with significantly greater infectivity and viru- lence overwhelm innate immunity.2. Why are influenza epidemics so explosive?Predictable fall and winter impairments in innate immunity in temperate latitudes – and less predictable recurrent impairments in subequatorial and equato- rial latitudes – would cause a percentage of the non- immune population to become suddenly susceptible to background influenza virus. The size of that suscep- tible subpopulation would vary, not only by the size of their impairments in innate immunity, but with the transmissibility and virulence of the virus, and the per- centage of the population with competent adaptive immunity. Abrupt deficiencies in innate immunity, especially when large segments of the population also have inadequate adaptive immunity, would allow qui- escent influenza to erupt.3. Why do epidemics end so abruptly?The rapid depletion of the population with both impaired innate and inadequate adaptive immunity may explain the abrupt disappearance of influenza. Impairments in innate immunity may also increase transmission, in effect, turning more infectors, symp- tomatic or not, into good transmitters. Furthermore, if only a small population of good transmitters – and not all the sick – usually spread the virus, and their transmission period is limited, the epidemic would end shortly after the good transmitters lose their infec- tivity.4.

If the virus had already imbedded itself in a pop- ulation and a subgroup of the infected became good transmitters when their innate immunity declines to a critical threshold, such transmitters would coinciden- tally infect populations at similar latitudes made sus- ceptible by those same impairments in innate immunity. in illness response.9. Over the last 20 years, why has influenza mortality in Good transmitters explain the difficulty identifying influenza's serial interval especially since influenza's incubation period is well known. If only subpopula- tions of infected persons are good transmitters, and if their infectious period is limited, then the serial inter- val would remain obscure until we identified the good transmitters. Vitamin D induced variations in natural immunity may also affect influenza's incubation period, further obfuscating the serial interval. increased vaccination of the aged are inadequate to compensate for declines in innate immunity the aged suffered over that same time. The studies we identified found a secondary attack rate of around 20%, impossibly low for a highly infectious virus spread from the sick to the well. If only a subpop- ulation of the infected, the good transmitters, are infective, this would explain the surprisingly low sec- ondary attack rates. Current estimates of secondary attack rates assume the first case in the family is the index case and is spreading the disease. However, if only a subpopulation of infected persons transmit the disease, the true secondary attack rate could not be accurately determined until we identify the good infectors. are considered in context with the novelty, transmissibil- ity, and virulence of the attacking virus, the conundrums are fewer. A subpopulation of good transmitters among the infected further clarifies influenza's confusing epide- If influenza were embedded in the population, only to erupt when impairments in innate immunity create a susceptible subpopulation, the disease would only give the appearance of spreading. Instead, it would appear in large segments of the population seasonally, and almost simultaneously, as long as good transmit- ters were available. Furthermore, as good transmitters traveled, populations with neither adequate innate immunity nor competent adaptive immunity may suc- cumb. That is, the disease would actually spread, as good transmitters traveled and subsequently infected well subpopulations with impaired immunity. season [40,41].

Evidence continues to accumulate of vitamin D's involvement in a breathtak-  ing array of human disease and death.

Twenty-five years later, Aloia and Li-Ng found 2,000 IU of vitamin D per day abolished the seasonality of influenza and dramatically reduced its self-reported incidence [25].  (Figure 2) Hence, we propose this modification of Hope- Simpson's theory. We do not expect our revisions to prove  invincible, nor do we delude ourselves that influenza is now comprehensible.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 has become a global health concern, causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Current evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 spread to humans via transmission from wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of the Coronaviridae family but is distinct from SARS-CoV (identity of approximately 79%) and MERS-CoV (identity of approximately 50%) [1,2]. Knowing the origin of such a pathogen is critical to developing the means to block further transmission and vaccines [3].

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Human-to-human transmis- sion via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces has been described, with incubation times of 2-14 days. Early diagnosis, quarantine, and supportive treatments are essential to cure patients. This paper reviews the literature on all available information about the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation and treatments of COVID-19. Treatments, including antiviral agents, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids, antibodies, convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccines, are discussed in this article. In addition, regis- tered trials investigating treatment options for COVID-19 infection are listed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy. All rights reserved.NANA March 16, 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 generated 168 826 con- ﬁrmed cases, including 6503 deaths worldwide. In China during There is a current worldwide outbreak of a new type of coro- all over the country supported Wuhan. Moreover, the government shared the updated genome sequence of COVID-19 to the public, and scientists from China and overseas are working closely and eﬃciently on this public health emergency [5,6]. Due to interven- tions and control measures from the government (shutting down public transportation and implementing a treatment strategy) and the change in personal behaviors (wearing masks and reducing contact with others), the number of conﬁrmed and suspected cases in China has started to decrease. However, the transmission of pneumonia associated with SARS- CoV-2 has not yet been eliminated. The COVID-19 outbreak is still a major challenge for clinicians. The aim of this article is to describe the epidemiology, diagnosis, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19.2. EpidemiologyThe typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, sore throat,A study of early transmission dynamics of COVID-19 revealed that the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% conﬁdence ∗ Corresponding author.

Notably, a long incubation time means adjustments in screen- ing and control policies [10]. The 19-day incubation period is a low probability event, and experts suggest 14 days for quarantine.   2.2. Basic reproduction number     on the epidemiological setting, and is the most important parame-  ter to determine intrinsic transmissibility. The early outbreak data  largely follow exponential growth. Different models based on the  clinical progression of the disease were devised to estimate the ba-  sic reproduction number. In the early stages of COVID-19, the pan-  demic doubled in size every 7.4 days, and the basic reproduction  number was estimated to be 2.2 [7]. Another study estimated the  basic reproduction number as ranging from 2.24 to 3.58 [11]. How-  ever, a deterministic compartmental model based on the likelihood  and a model analysis showed that the control reproduction num-  ber may be as high as 6.47 [12]. The authors noted that this ba-  sic reproduction number was higher because the estimate accounts  for 3-4 generations of viral transmission and intensive social con-  tacts. The basic reproduction number estimated by the majority of  studies ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 [13], which is slightly higher than  that of SARS.   3. Diagnosis   trol outbreaks in the community and in hospitals [14]. Current  diagnostic tests for coronavirus include reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR),  and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal ampliﬁcation  (RT-LAMP) [15,16]. RT-LAMP has similar sensitivity to rRT-PCR, is  highly speciﬁc and is used to detect MERS-CoV [17,18]. According  to current diagnostic criteria founded by the China National Health  Commission, laboratory examinations, including nasopharyngeal  and oropharyngeal swab tests, have become a standard assess-  ment for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. To identify patients  earlier, two one-step quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were  developed to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the  SARS-CoV-2 genome [19]. Three novel RT-PCR assays targeting  the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike  (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were developed.  Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had  the lowest limit of detection in vitro; highly sensitive and speciﬁc  assays may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19  [20]. The SARS-CoV E gene assay was more sensitive than the  RdRp gene assay combined with the one-step RT-PCR system [21].  The E gene PCR was suﬃcient to diagnose a SARS-CoV-2 infection  but the RdRp protocol was recommended to conﬁrm a positive  result [22,23]. The overall positive rate of RT-PCR detection of  SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4880 cases from one hospital in Wuhan  was 38% [24]. The positive rate of PCR for oropharyngeal swabs  is not very high: only 53.3% of COVID-19-conﬁrmed patients had positive oral swabs tests [25]. In a series of 51 patients with conﬁrmed COVID-19 infection, 71% patients were RT-PCR positive at the ﬁrst time of testing of throat swab or sputum samples [26]. The RT-PCR results usually become positive after several days (2-8 days) [27]. Automated solutions for molecular diagnostics can handle large numbers of samples and can be scaled to keep pace with ﬂuctuating demand [28-30]. The good analytical performance of a molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on a high- throughput platform, the cobas 6800, was observed with minimal hands-on time, while offering fast and reliable results [31,32].  P. Zhai, Y. Ding and X. Wu et al. / International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents 55 (2020) 105955NA The current laboratory test is time-consuming, and a shortage of commercial kits delays diagnosis. For patients suffering from fever, sore throat, fatigue, coughing or dyspnea that is coupled with recent exposure, COVID-19 infection should be diagnosed with typical chest computerized tomography (CT) characteristics despite negative RT-PCR results [33]. Of 1014 patients, 59% had positive RT-PCR results, and 88% had positive chest CT scans [34].COVID-19 belongs to the Coronaviridae family; therefore, it is not surprising that COVID-19 has imaging ﬁndings that are similar to The basic reproduction number is model-based, largely depends those for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [35]. Typical CT ﬁndings in-cluded bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consol-idative pulmonary opacities, sometimes with a rounded morphol-ogy and peripheral lung distribution [33]. Eighty-six percent of pa-tients showed ground-glass opacities or consolidation, and morethan one lobe (71%) with bilateral involvement (76%) was affectedin the 21 initial chest CT scans [36]. Notably, lung cavitation, dis-crete pulmonary nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathywere absent [36]. Lung abnormalities on chest CT scan were mostsevere approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms[37]. Chest CT scans can be used to assess the severity of COVID-19. COVID-19 also manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalitiesin asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilat-eral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed toor co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining as-sessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory ﬁndingscould facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia [38-40]. As the diagnostic criteria expanded from laboratory examination to chest CT imaging, more than 14 0 0 0 patients were diagnosed on February 12, 2020. Rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 is crucial to con-4. IsolationNA Classical public health measures, including isolation, quaran-tine, social distancing and community containment, can be usedto curb the pandemic of this respiratory disease [41]. China hasbeen preparing since 2003 to contain future pandemics by apply-ing lessons learned from SARS [42]. In the COVID-19 pandemic,China issued the largest quarantine in history. All the residentsliving in mainland China were locked-in, and city public trans-portation, including buses, trains, ferries, and airports, were shut-down. Given the trajectory of this outbreak, the Chinese govern-ment scaled up such efforts to keep pace with the rapid increasein cases and geographical spread. The Wuhan government madefull use of the gym and two convention centers and transformedthem into makeshift hospitals with 3400 beds in only one night toisolate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls. More makeshifthospitals are under construction. Isolation beds were quickly ex-panded from only 137 at the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19 to 56 0 0 0 to separate infected patients from non-infected in-dividuals. The swift and decisive response of China contributed toreducing the control reproduction number and transmission risk.Due to the powerful and effective isolation measures taken by theChinese government, the increase in COVID-19 began to slow downon February 14, 2020, according to the data released by the ChinaNational Health Commission.NA 5. Treatments5.1. Antiviral agentsThere is no current evidence from randomized controlled tri- als (RCTs) to recommend any speciﬁc anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment for patients with a suspected or conﬁrmed COVID-19 infection. Lopinavir (LPV) inhibits the protease activity of coronavirus in vitro and in animal studies. A retrospective, matched-cohort studyincluding 1052 SARS patients showed that LPV/ritonavir as ini- tial treatment was associated with a reduced death rate (2.3% vs. 11.0%) [43]. The protease inhibitor LPV is an effective treatment based on the experience accumulated from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, indicating it is a potential treatment option for COVID- 19 [44]. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, is an antiviral compound used to treat several virus infections, including respiratory syn- cytial virus, hepatitis C virus, and some viral hemorrhagic fevers. Promising results were obtained with ribavirin in a MERS-CoV rhe- sus macaque model [45]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) model is targeted by ribavirin after se- quence analysis, modeling, and docking to build the model. This feature increases its potential as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 [46].  disease [47]. Remdesivir shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses, and it may compete for RdRp [48]. Remdesivir and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and ri- tonavir in vitro [49]. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, both prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir improved pulmonary function and reduced lung viral loads and severe lung pathology [50]. In a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection, prophy- lactic remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 h prior to inoculation, and MERS-CoV did not induce clinical disease and did not replicate in respiratory tissues, thus preventing the formation of lung lesions [51]. In cell-based assays, the triphosphate form of remdesivir in- corporated at position i, and RNA chain termination was delayed, which explained the high potency of remdesivir against RNA [52]. Remdesivir was used to treat the ﬁrst case of COVID-19 infection in the United States: the patient’s clinical condition improved af- ter only one day of remdesivir treatment [53]. A phase II clinical trial of remdesivir was performed by the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and a phase III clinical trial was performed by the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. The results of these clinical tri- als will be revealed in April 2020. Remdesivir improved pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. In contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb only slightly re- duced viral loads and did not impact other disease parameters, and therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb improved pulmonary function, but did not reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology [49]. Over- all, these results indicated that remdesivir showed more potential than LPV/RTV-IFNb [54]. In a case report, lopinavir/ritonavir (Kale- tra®) and arbidol were associated with signiﬁcant improvements in COVID-19 patients [55]. The eﬃcacy and safety of these antivi- ral agents for COVID-19 will be assessed in further clinical trials. Thirty-four trials of antiviral agents in patients with COVID-19 have been registered up to March 15, 2020 (Table 1).  5.2. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine   ease drug that has been reported to be a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug [56-58]. Chloroquine is known to block virus in- fection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV [59]. The ﬁrst results obtained from more than 100 patients showed the apparent eﬃcacy of chloroquine in terms of reduction of exacerbation of pneumonia, duration of symptoms and delay of viral clearance, all in the absence of severe side effects [60]. Chloroquine was included in the recommendations for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia [60,61]. The optimal dosage of chloroquine for SARS-CoV-2 will need to be assessed in future trials [62].  fewer concerns about drug-drug interactions [63]. In the previ- ous SARS outbreak, hydroxychloroquine was reported to have anti-  P. Zhai, Y. Ding and X. Wu et al. / International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents 55 (2020) 105955NA SARS-CoV activity in vitro [64]. Using physiologically-based phar- macokinetic (PBPK) models, hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells [65]. Cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 have been reported to be increased in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [66,67]. This may progress to a cytokine storm, followed by multiorgan failure and death. Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have immunomodulatory ef- fects and can suppress the immune response [68,69]. Therefore, 21 clinical studies were launched by Chinese hospitals and the Univer- sity of Oxford to evaluate the eﬃcacy of these agents in COVID-19 infection (Table 2). It is also necessary to determine whether the beneﬁt of chloroquine therapy depends on the age of the patient and the clinical presentation or stage of the disease [70]. If clinical data conﬁrm the biological results, chloroquine and hydroxychloro- The antiviral agent, remdesivir was designed for the Ebola virus individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [71].NA5.3. CorticosteroidsIn a study of 41 COVID-19 patients, 21% received corticosteroids, which could suppress lung inﬂammation [66]. The administered dose of methylprednisolone varied depending on disease severity. Current interim guidance from the WHO on the clinical manage- ment of severe acute respiratory infection when SARS-CoV-2 infec- tion is suspected (released January 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. The clin- ical outcomes of coronavirus and similar outbreaks do not support the use of corticosteroids. In a retrospective observational study of 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ven- tilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy [72]. For the management of SARS, corticosteroid treatment was more associ- ated with psychosis, diabetes and avascular necrosis [73,74]. Over- all, there is no unique reason to expect that patients with COVID- 19 infection will beneﬁt from corticosteroids, and such treatment may be harmful [75]. However, according to our clinical expe- rience, corticosteroids could be prescribed at the right time for the right patients. The clinical trials involving corticosteroids are shown in Table 3.NA5.4. AntibodiesThe development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19 has important implications. Considering the relatively high identity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV- 2 and SARS-CoV, the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibod- Chloroquine is a widely-used antimalarial and autoimmune dis- tein is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Fortunately, the SARS-CoV-speciﬁc human monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds potently with the COVID-19 RBD [76]. However, other SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies 230, m396 and 80R cannot bind to the COVID-19 RBD [77]. CR3022 may be a potential therapeutic can- didate, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. Antibod- ies MAb114 and REGN-EB3 were designed for treatment of Ebola virus infection and signiﬁcantly reduce mortality from Ebola virus disease [47]. Monoclonal antibodies can only recognize a single antigen epitope, which limits the use of MAb114 and REGN-EB3 in the treatment of COVID-19. However, the development of COVID- Hydroxychloroquine is a chloroquine analog for which there are monoclonal antibodies for new pathogens to clinical practice in a short time.4    Table 1 Clinical trials of antiviral agents in patients with COVID-19.

Convalescent plasma transfusion   set in the treatment of SARS, and the pooled odds of mortality following treatment was reduced compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25) [78]. However, in Ebola virus disease, the transfusion of up to 500 mL of convalescent plasma in 84 pa- tients was not associated with a signiﬁcant improvement in sur- vival [79]. In a laboratory test, the COVID-19 virus was isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid of a critically ill patient, and it could be neutralized by sera from several patients [80]. Current clinical trials involving convalescent plasma transfusion are shown in Table 4. The National Health Commission of China appealed to convalescent patients to donate blood for the treatment of COVID- 19 infection. Convalescent plasma should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure a high neutralization antibody titer. The diﬃculty in obtaining plasma during convalescence limits its clinical application. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to fur- ther evaluate the eﬃcacy and safety of convalescent plasma ther- apy in patients with COVID-19 infection.   5.6. Vaccines     and this should enable the rapid development and evaluation of  medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health  crisis [77]. These ﬁndings provide the basis for further studies  to optimize vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.  The majority of the vaccines being developed for coronaviruses  target the spike glycoprotein or S protein [81]. Vaccine devel-  opment is a long process, and no vaccines are available at the  time of a pandemic outbreak. For example, the Ebola epidemic  outbreak occurred in 2013, and three years later, the rVSV Ebola  Vaccine was selected for phase I clinical trials for its safety and  immunogenicity in Africa and Europe [82]. In November 2019, the  European Commission granted marketing authorization to Merck  Sharp and Dohme B.V. in Europe for their Ebola vaccine, Ervebo.  Fortunately, Moderna company announced on February 24, 2020  that the company’s experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, known  as mRNA-1273, is ready for human testing. It is a remarkably fast  development cycle to develop an initial vaccine just weeks after  identifying the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence. The clinical trial  of safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in the treatment  of COVID-19 is under investigation (ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer:  NCT04283461). Moreover, a new oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has been  successfully developed at Tianjin University, which uses food-grade  safe Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a carrier and targets the S protein.  There are 18 biotechnology companies and universities in China  working on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have  been developed much faster than those for Ebola because of  the collaborative efforts of scientists around the world and the  fast-track approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development efforts by  the Chinese health organizations.   6. Conclusions   of a variety of coronaviruses, and these viruses have crossed species barriers to infect humans and many different kinds of animals, including avians, rodents, and chiropters [83,84]. While the origin of COVID-19 is still being investigated, COVID-19 has features typical of the Coronaviridae family and was classiﬁed in the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage. COVID-19 can be transmitted between humans. Interventions, including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the  P. Zhai, Y. Ding and X.

Identiﬁcation of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treat- ment, control the pandemic, and reduce the economic impact of COVID-19 on China and the world. In acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respira- tory secretions. The positive rate of PCR from oropharyngeal swabs is not very high. In this situation, more swab testing is needed to clarify diagnosis. Typical CT ﬁndings can help early screening of suspected cases and diagnosis of COVID-19. The COVID-19 infection has a clustering onset and is more likely to affect older males (average age 51 years) with comorbidities [86]. No evidence supports adverse birth outcomes, intrauterine infection, or vertical transmission of COVID-19 [87]. However, vi- ral infections can be acquired when the infant passes through the birth canal during vaginal delivery or through postpartum breast- feeding [88]. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, ex-pectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhea, and hemopty- sis [89].

Other organs are also susceptible to COVID-19.The single-cell RNA-seq data was used to analyse receptor ACE2expression to reveal the potential risk of different human organsto COVID-19 infection [91]. COVID-19 uses the same cell entry re-ceptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2, which regulates both cross-species andhuman-to-human transmissions [80]. Proximal tubular cells alsoexpress higher levels of the ACE2 receptor, which leads to suscep-tibility to COVID-19 [91] and induces kidney injury. Data from 33patients with a complete clinical course were analysed, and thelevels of blood urea and creatinine were higher in non-survivorsthan in survivors [92].All patients with COVID-19-infected pneumonia received an-tibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% receivedmethylprednisolone [92]. Clinical trials are underway to investigatethe eﬃcacy of new antiviral drugs, convalescent plasma transfu-sion, and vaccines. Most of the trials were initiated by investigatorsand the study period is 1 to 11 months. Although the ﬁnal resultsof these studies will take a long time to complete, the interim re-search data may provide some help for the current urgent demandfor therapy [93].The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency of in-ternational concern, and all countries need a coordinated inter-national effort to ﬁght COVID-19.

Five of seven human coronavirus was isolated in this century. Unfortunately, last three of them entered our life with a fear of outbreak, pandemic or death. Last human coronavirus which emerged world from Wuhan China, SARS CoV-2 and its clinical expression, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) recently taken a significant place in our daily practice. Initial reports showed that, its origin was bats. It transmitted human to human by droplet and contact routes, but some doubt about airborne, fecal or intrauterine transmission also should be removed. Its R0 value is 2.3 but it could be as high as 5.7. Its case fatality rate was 6.3, but it was different in different ages and counties, and it could be over 15%. According to early models total 10–12 weeks is required to control an outbreak in the community. While different countries show different daily case numbers, total number of case, case mortality rates or R0, it seems they show a similar epidemic curve. Every day we learn new data about the current outbreak. Since the outbreak is not over yet, every detail should be evaluated carefully and the updates should be followed closely to monitor the epidemiological properties of COVID-19.  Key words: SARS CoV-2, COVID-19, epidemiology, case fatality rate, transmission   1. Introduction Coronoviruses have been reported as causes of mild and moderate respiratory infections forover 50 years [1]. Even though this group of viruses have been isolated from many different animals, bats are accepted major natural reservoir of coronaviruses [2,3].  OC43, are known as causes of common cold in humans [1]. However, recently-detected coronaviruses, SARS CoV (2002), MERS-CoV (2012) completely altered all known approaches about this virus group because these viruses caused severe acute respiratory infections and nosocomial outbreaks. In the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2 (2019), suddenly emerged in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared that the epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020. As of April 16, 2020, the emerging coronavirus infection, COVID-19, has been spreading worldwide, causing over 2 million cases and over 137 thousand of death.  place in our daily practice, as a new group of respiratory diseases, due to their higher rates of transmissibility, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, severity of * Correspondence: cmlbulut@yahoo.com     Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences (2020) 50: 563-570 http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/medical/ © TÜBİTAK Review ArticleNANA Epidemiology of COVID-19 1, Cemal BULUT *, Yasuyuki KATO NA 2 Department of Infectious Diseases International University of Health and Welfare, Narita Hospital Narita, JapanNA Received: 16.04.2020NANANANANANANANA disease, mortality and so on, we should pay more attention than past to prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection.2. Origin of the SARS CoV-2 virus The first cases of coronavirus disease COVID-19 were Four human coronavirus, 229E, HKU1, NL63 and investigations suggested that the origin of SARSCoV-2 may be bats. Zhou et al. demonstrate that SARS CoV-2 possesses 96% nucleotide identity with a bat coronavirus, for instance BetaCoV/RaTG13/2013 [4].3. Epidemic curve of infection An epidemic curve of infection is a statistical chart used in epidemiology to visualize the onset of the coronavirus outbreak. In an epidemic curve, there are three zones: increasing, plateau, and declining phases. Increasing phase: This period is affected by many different parameters such as country demographics, age distribution, preparedness of health system to an outbreak, In as much as this disease recently taken a significant reaction time to a pandemic, reaction of society to new implementing rules. Different countries can exhibit quite different curve patterns and these facts could complicate563This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.to make any assumption about pandemic pattern for a country (Figure 1). However, it seems that this period takes generally 3 or 4 weeks for COVID-19 (Table 1).  According to daily country reports it takes 2 or 3 weeks for COVID-19 (Table1).  about this phase (Figure 2), showing that 2 or 3 weeks later disease activity could be detected very low levels.  4. Incubation period The incubation period of COVID-19 was defined 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1–12.5 days), 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days) and 4 days in three separate study [5,6]. However, in a familial cluster of 5 patients, this period was reported between 1 and 19 days [7]. These data show that the incubation period of COVID-19 was similar to MERS and SARS and it’s a bit longer than influenza [8].  5. Severity of infection COVID-19 has been reported form all aged patients. Severity of infection could be varied from asymptomatic infection to critical disease. Clinical severity of COVID-19 was defined in 5 groups as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Diagnostic criteria of these groups were as follows [9, 10];  of symptoms with positive SARSCoV-2 PCR test.  infection, including fever, fatigue, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing without pneumonia.         564  BULUT and KATO / Turk J Med Sci3. Moderate: With pneumonia, frequent fever and cough; some may have wheezing, but no obvious hypoxemia such as shortness of breath. Plateau phase: At this phase disease incidence is stable. with central cyanosis, oxygen saturation less than 92%, with other manifestations of hypoxemia. Decreasing phase: Today we have only China’s data syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure, shock, multiple organ dysfunction. This clinical classification is also important because it gives some clues about prognosis and mortality of COVID-19. Most COVID-19 cases (81%) were classified as mild or moderate disease in adults, and in children most cases were mild. [9,11,12]. In critical cases mortality could be as higher as 50% in adults [9,11].5.1. Asymptomatic infection Asymptomatic infection has a special importance as a source of disease in the community. Especially, asymptomatic infants and children may take an important role in human-to-human transmission [13]. Dong and colleagues report that over 90% of pediatric patients could be asymptomatic, or could have mild or moderate disease [11]. It seems that asymptomatic infection could be detected at every age, although it was frequent at younger ages [14]. These asymptomatic patients could 1.

Route of transmission In spite of the fact that some animals are thought as origins of the virus, a major transmission mode for SARS CoV-2 is human-to-human transmission like SARS CoV and MERS CoV. Accepted transmission routes of COVID-19 are droplet and contact transmission [18].

Daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people for China (Source: OurWorld in Data, accessed 13 April 2020).NA Nevertheless, explaining or excluding of other possible transmission routes is necessary for controlling disease in the community. 6.1. Airborne transmission Current evidence shows that SARS CoV-2 was detected in air samples for up to 3 h in experimental models [19]. Gou et al. found that air samples were positive in many different sites of wards [20]. However, when Cheng et al. collected 8 air samples at a distance of 10 cm from the patient’s chin565with or without wearing a surgical mask, they were not able to detect SARS CoV-2 [21]. Another study, although some environmental samples were positive for SARS CoV- 2, all air samples were negative [22]. In a study from Iran, authors reported that all air samples collected 5 m around the patients were negative [23].  different patients and methods were included; in which stage of disease these samples were collected, or what kind of procedures were performed. Today, we have not known yet whether detected SARS CoV-2 in air samples are viable or not, or whether detected viral loads are high enough to cause COVID-19. It is important to realize here that prior to answering such questions and obtain some strong evidence, taking airborne precautions for aerosol producing process seems to be logical.  6.2. Fecal transmission Fecal transmission is another unanswered question about COVID-19. Presence of patients with diarrhea [6], finding of fecal samples positive for SARS CoV by RT- PCR [24,25] and detection of live virus in stool at least one study [25], suggest that stool is infectious even though it has not been verified by other studies [24]. Detection of SARS CoV-2 RNA in patients’ fecal samples with negative  respiratory tract samples for a mean of 11 days might be  important [26]. Even if gastrointestinal involvement or  digested sputum was the origin of virus existence in the  stool, this fact gives another reason to emphasize good  personal hygiene. Possibility of fecal transmission remains  unanswered until viable virus is detected in stool samples and new data is available to prove oral-fecal transmission, which affect procedures for quarantine, hospitalization and self-isolation practices.  6.3. Maternal fetal transmission  Intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected  pregnant women to their fetuses is another important point  for transmission. According to a study about analyzing  of 38 pregnant women with COVID-19, there were no signs of intrauterine transmission of SARS CoV-2 from mothers to their fetuses [27]. Studies also emphasized that the course of COVID-19 was normal in pregnant women as opposed to those of SARS and MERS [27,28]. Another study also reviewed that we have no definitive evidence of vertical transmission [29].  7. Transmission period People infected with SARS CoV-2 can be contagious prior to onset of symptoms. In a study, 13% of patients were contagious before onset of symptoms [30]. In a familial cluster, 3 of 8 laboratory-confirmed patients were asymptomatic [31]. Presymptomatic transmission would be a challenge to contact tracing [32]. These kind of reports show that asymptomatic carriers emerge as an important  566  BULUT and KATO / Turk J Med Scitarget group to be taken into consideration in the control of the disease. Viral shedding might be longer than previously thought. In a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 191 adult patients, the median duration of viral shedding was found to be 20 days (IQR 17.0–24.0) and the longest There are some limitations in these studies where days [33].A study of postdischarge surveillance of patients after clinical recovery, two patients were found positive [34].8. Susceptible ages Although COVID-19 was reported from every aged patient, patients with advanced age seem more susceptible to infection. An early report shows that the most affectedage group was middle ages (Table 2). Among children and young adults, infection rates were very low and it changed between 0.8%–4.0%. In addition, asymptomatic infection rate is quite high in this ages.9. Transmissibility and R0 Early reports from China show that a reproductive number for COVID-19 was 2.2 to 2.7 days [5]. This means that thenumber of infected person will be doubled every 6–7 day.A reproductive number of the outbreak on the DiamondPrincess Cruise Ship also supports this preliminary data[35]. However, Sanche et al. found that a serial intervalwas 5.7 days (95% CI, 3.8–8.9 days) [36]. In another studywhich prefer to use real-time reproduction number (Rt)instead of basic reproduction number (R0), Yuan et al. showed that their Rt values for Italy, Germany, France and Spain were 3.1, 4.43, 6.56, and 3.95, respectively [37]. Liu et al. found that average R0 was 3.8 (1.4–6.49) in theirreview of 14 studies [38]. This study also showed that evenin the same geographic region, different Ro values can becalculated by using different methods and assumptions. Itseems that we need more data to determine more accurateR0 value.10. Case fatality rate Overall case fatality rate was 6.3 according to WHO situation report as of April 13, 2020 [39]. Nevertheless, a remarkable difference in mortality rates was also noted between countries as given Table 3. It was noted that this rate is extremely higher in country with older-aged populations. In Italy, the median age of those died from COVID-19 was 78 years, whilst the median age of patients was 62 [40]. In Turkey, the current case fatality rate is 2.1% which is a significant issue to bear in mind. Mortality associated with COVID-19 is a multifactorial process and underlying diseases and health care burden as well as ages could be related to higher mortality [41].NATable 2.

Mortality by ages Increasing of mortality with advanced age is now a well- known fact. It is also well known that success in prevention of COVID-19 among these age groups directly determines th emortality rate in countries. Early Chinese reports showed that mortality rate could be 3 times higher in older patients especially those at age over 80 [9]. In an Italian study, ICU mortality was 26% whereas it was 36% after 65 of ages [42]. Demonstration of median days between onset of symptoms to death was shorter in older patients which is another important point [43].  related deaths were reported in an age group over 70 years [44].

Similar results were also reported form USA [45]. 10.2. Risks for disease and death Disease progression can be rapid and the median survival time can be as short as 5 days in advanced aged patients [28]. In a metaanalysis which evaluated 46,248 patients from eight studies, most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. Another finding of this study was that these comorbidities were more likely detected in severe patients [47]. Another metaanalysis showed As of April 7, 2020 in Italy, 83% of all COVID-19 mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were most567frequently detected underlying diseases among hospitalized patients [48].  comorbid condition can increase fatality rate by 10.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6.0% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer [9].  COVID-19, most frequently detected comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic renal failure as 72%, 31.5%, 27.4%, and 23.5%, respectively. This report showed that patients without any comorbidities accounted for only 2.8% of those died from COVID-19 [40].  was higher in hypertensive patients nearly 2.5 fold increases especially among advanced aged individuals [49].  568  BULUT and KATO / Turk J Med SciTable 3.

Epidemics occur in the winter months in temperate locations and at varying times of the year in subtropical and tropical locations. Most influenza virus infections cause mild and self-limiting disease, and around one-half of all infections occur with a fever. Only a small minority of infections lead to serious disease requiring hospitalization. During epidemics, the rates of influenza virus infections are typically highest in school-age children. The clinical severity of infections tends to increase at the extremes of age and with the presence of underlying medical conditions, and impact of epidemics is greatest in these groups. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent infections, and in recent years influenza vaccines have become the most frequently used vaccines in the world. Nonpharmaceutical public health measures can also be effective in reducing transmission, allowing suppression or mitigation of influenza epidemics and pan- www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA demics.NANA H fections occur around the world each year.

Occasionally, inﬂuenza pandemics occur when a novel strain emerges INFLUENZA TRANSMISSION from animals and is able to spread among hu- mans (Saunders-Hastings and Krewski 2016). Whereas most infections are associated with mild and self-limiting disease, older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions can be more vulnerable to more serious disease and inﬂuenza epidemics tend to have the great-NAEditors: Gabriele Neumann and Yoshihiro Kawaoka Additional Perspectives on Influenza: The Cutting Edge available at www.perspectivesinmedicine.org Copyright © 2021 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved; doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a038356 Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med 2021;11:a0383561Downloaded from http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/ on July 2, 2025 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressNANAS.

At the beginning of an epidemic, in a completely susceptible population with no public health measures in place, transmissibility can be mea- SEASONALITY IN DIFFERENT CLIMATE sured by the basic reproductive number, often ZONES written as “R0.” This quantity is formally de- ﬁned as the mean number of secondary infec- tious cases generated from a typical primary infectious case in a completely susceptible pop- ulation. One review study reported that the me- dian basic reproduction number for the 1918 pandemic was 1.80 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.47–2.27), 1.65 (IQR: 1.53–1.70) for the 1957 pandemic, 1.80 (IQR: 1.56–1.85) for the 1968 pandemic, 1.46 (IQR: 1.30–1.70) for the 2009 pandemic, and 1.28 (IQR: 1.19–1.37) for sea- sonal inﬂuenza (Biggerstaff et al. 2014). One implication of this is that between one-third and one-half of all transmission events must be prevented by public health measures to bring the reproductive number below the critical threshold of 1 and stop an epidemic. As infections spread, leading to a buildup of www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA immunity in the population, transmissibility will gradually decline. Changes over time in transmissibility can be reﬂected by a metric known as the effective reproduction number at time t (Rt), which is the number of secondary INCIDENCE OF INFECTIONS infections generated by a typical infection with illness onset at calendar time t. As an epidemic proceeds, Rt will tend to decline, and will drop below the critical threshold of 1 at around the epidemic peak. Monitoring Rt can also give in- formation on the impact of public health mea- sures on transmission (Ali et al. 2018; Cowling et al. 2020; Ryu et al. 2020a). Understanding the ways in which inﬂuenza transmission occurs is important to determine which types of control measures would be most appropriate to recommend. For example, if in- ﬂuenza often spreads through contaminated surfaces, hand hygiene would be a particularly important and efﬁcacious intervention. Most in- ﬂuenza transmission is thought to occur during close contact by droplets or aerosols that travel through the air from one person to another, without involving hands or fomites. However, the size of droplets or aerosols responsible for transmission remains a topic of considerableNA 2Downloaded from http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/ on July 2, 2025 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressNANAHuman Inﬂuenza EpidemiologyNA over time. In most inﬂuenza epidemics, the in- cidence of infections is higher in children than adults. One recent study estimated that ∼3%–11% of individuals in the United States suffer symptomatic inﬂuenza each year, with an average incidence of 8.7% in children and 5.1% in adults (Tokars et al. 2018). In the 2009 inﬂuenza pandemic, laboratory diagnostics were more widely used particularly among inpatients, although it can be difﬁcult to interpret incidence rates of laboratory-con- ﬁrmed cases if testing practices vary over time. Virologic surveillance could provide accurate in- formation on relative changes in incidence of infections over time as long as health-care-seek- ing behaviors and testing practices are stable over time. Combining surveillance of medically attended ILI with virologic data on the propor- tion of ILI associated with inﬂuenza has been used as a correlate of the incidence of infections in some studies (Goldstein et al. 2011; Wong et al. 2013b; Yang et al. 2015). In addition to surveillance of medically at- www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA tended inﬂuenza, infections and illness can also be measured by epidemiological studies in the general community (Monto 1994).

Ryu and B.J. CowlingNA fusion of changes in antibody titer following vaccination versus infection (Chen et al. 2018; Khurana et al. 2019). Incidence can also be measured in closed settings such as schools and households, and outbreak investigations or transmission studies can provide valuable data on infections and ill- nesses. For example, prospective follow-up of individuals exposed to infection can provide data on the proportion of virologically con- ﬁrmed infections that lead to certain clinical signs or symptoms or increases in antibody ti- ters, facilitating interpretation of surveillance data from the broader population (Tsang et al. 2016). One of the key determinants of the inci- dence of an inﬂuenza strain is its transmissibil- ity, or its propensity to spread in a population. Transmissibility is affected by the degree of in- fectiousness of those infected, the susceptibility of those in contact with infected individuals, and the degree of contact between infectious and susceptible individuals. Transmissibility is not www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA a biological constant and can be modiﬁed by population behaviors and public health mea- sures. Tracking transmissibility over time allows public health authorities to determine the strength of measures needed to bring an epi- demic under control. to the risk of having a more serious health out- come: for example, the risk of illness conditional SERIOUSNESS OR SEVERITY PROFILE OF on infection, the risk of hospitalization condi- INFECTIONS tional on illness, the risk of death conditional on “Seriousness,” or severity, describes the patho- genicity or the capacity of an inﬂuenza strain to cause disease. One of the most common mea- sures of seriousness is the case fatality risk (Nishiura 2010), often referred to as the case fatality rate, although it is not a rate (Kelly and Cowling 2013). The numerator is the estimated number of deaths, the denominator is the esti- mated number of cases, and it is important to clarify the speciﬁc measures used for each of these. In the early stages of an epidemic, some infections may not have resolved, so that the number of deaths divided by the number of cas- es could underestimate the case fatality risk if some of the current cases would later die (Jewell et al. 2007). It is possible to include only deathsNA 4Downloaded from http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/ on July 2, 2025 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressNANAHuman Inﬂuenza EpidemiologyNA these fractions are challenging to estimate. Esti- mates of the asymptomatic fraction of infections have varied between 10% and 90%, depending on the approaches used and the precise deﬁni- tion of “asymptomatic” (Leung et al. 2015). In community studies with intense monitoring of exposed persons, around one-half of infections are associated with a fever (Lau et al. 2012; Ip et al. 2016). Prospective assessment of the likely impact of an inﬂuenza epidemic or pandemic can help to determine the types of public health measures that might be justiﬁed to reduce transmission. In March 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the Pandemic Inﬂuenza Severity Assessment approach to improve and standardize severity assessment and to enable a real-time assessment to guide response (World Health Organization 2017b). The components in this assessment include transmissibility of in- ﬂuenza, the seriousness of disease, and the po- tential impact on the society as a whole. The seriousness proﬁle of infections is typically the www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA most difﬁcult parameter to evaluate in real time (Wong et al. 2013a). pandemics have been associated with a greater mortality impact in younger individuals, either THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF because of increases in the incidence of infection INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTIONS or severity or both, metrics such as years of life Inﬂuenza epidemics and pandemics can have considerable morbidity and mortality impact. The inﬂuenza H1N1 pandemic in 1918/1919 had a particularly high impact (Pappas et al. 2008). It had three separate waves during 1918–1919 and caused 50–80 million deaths (Taubenberger and Morens 2006). Two other inﬂuenza pandemics occurred in the twentieth century with lower impact (Table 1). In AprilTable 1.

Ryu and B.J. CowlingNA demics than in seasonal epidemics (Nicoll et al. 2012). First, the factors were associated with real differences in inﬂuenza-associated death. This includes the characteristics of the virus such as virulence and transmissibility, population struc- ture such as access to health care, the prevalence of commodities, and level of population immu- nity. Second, the factors were associated with the methodology of case identiﬁcation. This in- cludes different types of mortality surveillance, differences in laboratory testing, accessibility of test- and case-reporting systems, and different physician’s awareness of inﬂuenza tests. Inﬂuenza-attributable mortality has been widely estimated by measuring the excess mor- tality during inﬂuenza epidemics compared with baseline threshold, which are usually ac- quired from statistical and modeling methods (Li et al. 2018). The Serﬂing least-squares cycli- cal regression model is one of the most widely used methods, relying on a sinusoidal baseline curve ﬁtted to historical mortality data (Serﬂing 1963). This model does not require virological www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA Vaccines data and provides a simple approach to estimate excess deaths, although it is not suitable for locations with weak inﬂuenza seasonality. Re- gression models, which include virological surveillance data, are often now preferred for estimating inﬂuenza virus-type and subtype- speciﬁc mortality and can avoid overestimation of deaths caused by cold weather or other respi- ratory infections. Another approach is counting the number of inﬂuenza deaths. However, there are a num- ber of limitations to this approach. First, mortality associated with inﬂuenza could be un- derestimated because infected individuals may not be identiﬁed by medical institutions or in- fected individuals identiﬁed at the medical in- stitution but not conﬁrmed by laboratory test- ing. In addition, inﬂuenza virus infections may cause secondary bacterial pneumonia (Davis et al. 2012) or may aggravate underlying illness such as cardiovascular diseases. Inﬂuenza virus infections are thought to lead to increases in cardiovascular events, although these are rarely recorded as inﬂuenza-associated events because inﬂuenza is not suspected in the etiology of these events and virus shedding may already haveNA 6Downloaded from http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/ on July 2, 2025 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressNANAHuman Inﬂuenza EpidemiologyNA trolled trials, which require substantial resourc- es, or classical observational studies that can suffer various biases including confounding (Jackson et al. 2006). Over the last few years, the “test-negative design” has been increasingly used for monitoring vaccine effectiveness (Sul- livan et al. 2014). This study design is a variation of the case-control study, in which patients are enrolled if they visited an outpatient clinic (or were hospitalized, in some studies) with symptoms of inﬂuenza and were tested for the presence of inﬂuenza virus. Vaccination effec- tiveness can be measured by calculating the odds of vaccination coverage between the enrolled patients testing positive and negative for inﬂu- enza (Jackson and Nelson 2013). the limited supply of antivirals and a delay in the availability of speciﬁc vaccines.

In general, most randomized trials www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA of antivirals have been conducted against mild and self-limiting disease, and there is relatively less evidence for their efﬁcacy in treating severe inﬂuenza (Kelly and Cowling 2015). However, in practice, antivirals are most useful for treating severe inﬂuenza and are less commonly used in outpatient settings.

Ryu and B.J. CowlingNA particular. Figure 2 indicates the problem with limited health system capacity, which can sur- pass 100% capacity even in average inﬂuenza seasons. “Flattening the curve” with NPIs could allow time for capacity to be increased. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, NPIs bought time for construction of ﬁeld hospitals to pro- vide extra capacity for patient isolation and treatment. Personal protective measures such as hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette are often rec- ommended in inﬂuenza epidemics and pan- demics, although there is limited evidence for their effectiveness (Xiao et al. 2020). A random- ized controlled trial of hand hygiene in 60 ele- mentary school children in Egypt found that hand hygiene signiﬁcantly reduced laboratory- conﬁrmed inﬂuenza cases by >50% (Talaat et al. 2011). However, other randomized trials did not identify signiﬁcant effects of hand hygiene (Xiao et al. 2020). Face masks have been one of the most con- troversial public health measures in the COVID- www.perspectivesinmedicine.orgNANA 19 pandemic of 2020. There is mechanistic evidence supporting the efﬁcacy of face masks in ﬁltering inﬂuenza virus if worn by infected persons (Milton et al. 2013; Leung et al. 2020). However, there is less evidence for their effec- tiveness in reducing transmission in the com- munity, and a meta-analysis of randomized tri- als did not identify signiﬁcant effects (Xiao et al. 2020). It remains plausible, from all available evidence, that widespread use of face masks could have a small-to-moderate effect in reduc- ing inﬂuenza transmission in the community. Isolation of infected persons can be an effec- tive way to reduce transmission (Fong et al. 2020). One of the most important public health messages in an inﬂuenza epidemic can be for ill persons to stay at home. The duration of home isolation could be until a fever subsides or for the ﬁrst few days of illness. One complication would be the access to sick pay, particularly for self- employed or contract workers, because other- wise these individuals may need to continue to work while ill. Quarantine is deﬁned as the restriction of movement of exposed persons who are often identiﬁed by contact tracing.

In Mexico alone, at the beginning of the epidemic, every day led to a loss of $57 million, and the World Bank estimates that the pan- demic may cost as much as $3 trillion.Despite the progress in molecular bi-ology and vaccine research, the produc-tion of H1N1 vaccine is still occurring in sonal influenza and all known pandemics chicken eggs, with a substantial delay in the production of adequate amounts of Influenza A virus contains an RNA ge- vaccine material for the entire world’s nome comprising eight RNA segments population.

In addition, the H1N1 is slow in acquiring resistance to oseltamivir; to date, only approximately 30 strains were reported as oseltamivir- encode for proteins critical for structure, resistant, allowing for effective treatment if therapy is started early in the course of the disease. The H1N1 flu is not limited to hu- tion (e.g., M1 or nucleoprotein) and may Dr. Rubinstein holds stock options and has con- Canada, Norway, and sporadically in the United States, defining this virus as zoonosis, or rather humano-zoonotic.

Of these, only H1, H2, and H3 in combination with N1 and N2 typically cause disease in humans (1). The remaining tend to be zoonotic, caus- ing disease in fowl and nonhuman mam- mals (1, 2). The human specificity is largely attributable to the receptor spec- ificity of hemagglutinin to target struc- tures of sialic acid present in human cells (1). Both these surface proteins undergo significant variation over the course of their replication and during repeated ep- idemics as a result of influenza’s error- prone RNA polymerase (1, 3, 5–7). Over the course of epidemics, insertions, dele- tions, and changes in the sequence of these genes result in polymorphisms ofand HA structures, although they are of insufficient magnitude to change their antigenic nomenclature; these polymor- phisms are termed antigenic drift (1, 3, 7). In other words, despite these muta- tions, the primary antigenic properties of theor HA protein in question are still maintained (e.g., H1), but these muta-  tions result in partial loss of host immu-  nity within a given population (2, 8). An-  tigenic shift, which may result in  pandemic spread because of lack of par-  tial immunity within the population, oc-  curs when a sufficiently antigenically dis-  tinct HA (with or without a new NA)  emerges (1, 6). Antigenic shift may occur either as a result of a reassortment event between human-adapted influenza and animal-adapted strains within a coin- fected host, resulting in a progeny virus capable of sustained human transmis- sion, or if a new human-adapted HA arises when an animal or avian influenza A virus is transmitted without reassort- ment from an animal reservoir to hu- mans (1, 3, 4). Neither the HA nor theneeds to be “numerically” different from the antigens circulating seasonally. The only prerequisite for antigenic shift (and therefore a potential for pandemic spread) is that little or no immunity from previous influenza infections or vaccina- tion exists in the population. For exam- ple, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain is significantly antigenically different from the previous circulating strains (includ- ing “seasonal” H1N1) (9).  within a population and its epidemic po- tential are entirely dependent on the evo- lution of its HA andgenes. As popu- lation immunity increases as a result of natural infection or vaccination, anti-  e2  genic shifts sufficient to negate preexist- ing host immunity drive continued spo- radic and epidemic infection but are insufficient to generate pandemics (1, 3, 6 – 8, 10). Antigenic shift, however, pro- duces a virus to which preexisting immu- nity is very low or absent, thereby expos- ing a very large susceptible population, potentially resulting in a pandemic. Influenza ecology is complicated by the presence of avian and mammalian clades of virus, relaxed host specificity, and the aforementioned antigenic evolu- tion. Several avian species serve as large reservoirs for influenza A viruses (1, 3). In general, these viruses appear to be in evolutionary stasis with their hosts and tend to cause asymptomatic infections. However, certain viruses that cause asymptomatic infection in shorebirds or waterfowl can cause fatal infection in other avian species, such as domestic poultry (1). Avian species are poorly adapted to human infection because their hemagglutinins typically do not have high affinity for mammalian sialic acid mitories, and the start of military recruit residues. As a result of this, avian-adapted courses have been suggested as contrib- viruses cannot cause sustained human uting factors (1–3, 6). Fomites may serve outbreaks or pandemics without appro- as a secondary mode of transmission, and priate spontaneous genetic alterations it has also been suggested that the higher that result in human host adaptations (1, intensity of sterilizing ultraviolet light in 3). Avian viruses can infect a limited the summer months may serve to reduce range of other mammals, including seals, the environmental burden of virus. Dry whales, horses, and pigs (1). Pigs may be environments, such as those that prevail readily infected with both avian and mammalian strains because of the pres- ence of both avian-like and mammal-like sialic acid residues in their tracheal epi- thelium (1). Pigs, therefore, may serve as a reservoir for intermingling and reas- sortment of mammalian and avian spe- cies, potentially resulting in antigenic shift. This potential for the pig to func- tion as a “mixing vessel” has been one of the reasons for the significant interest in China and Southeast Asia as a source of past and future pandemics, where inter- mingling of humans, domestic fowl, and pigs occurs at an intensity not seen any- where else on earth. Pigs also serve as reservoirs for swine influenza. Classic swine influenza causes mild influenza- like illness in pigs and, because the virus is mammalian, it can be transmitted to humans (1, 3). However, infections are The sustained survival of influenza contact to pigs and do not result in large- scale outbreaks or pandemics. Despite the swine HA orgene segments of swine influenza viruses that have adapted to human hosts by genetic rearrange-Crit Care Med 2010 Vol. 38, No. 4 (Suppl.)in colleges, individuals living in low so- cioeconomic conditions, daycare centers, and military settings.  viduals exposed to seasonal influenza may become infected. Average attack rates during epidemics range from 10% to 20% but may be as high as 40% to 50% in particularly susceptible populations (1, 3). The attack rate is typically highest in school-age children and daycare popula- tions (1–3, 7). This probably represents the higher intensity of transmission be- haviors in this population and a relatively low rate of immunity. In seasonal out- breaks, age-specific incidence generally follows a predictable course, with chil- dren being affected early in epidemics, followed by their adult caregivers, and, last, the elderly (1). Although immunity is the major factor in incidence of dis- ease, severity and morbidity of seasonal influenza are dependent on several host factors. The average influenza mortality in developed countries is approximately 12 in 100,000 persons, but certain popu- lations experience significantly higher morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza (6). These include those at the extremes of age, with a particularly steep increase in age-specific mortality after 64 yrs of age, and those with asthma and other chronic pulmonary diseases, car- diovascular diseases, diabetes, liver cir- rhosis, immunodeficiency states, hemo- globinopathies, malignancy, and renal dysfunction (2, 3, 7, 12, 13).  generally follow a predictable course. They begin abruptly, peak within 2 to 3 wks, and have a total duration of 5 to 10 wks. This pattern is also typically ob- served with pandemic influenza, al- though a much higher incidence is typi- cally noted, and second or subsequent waves of similar duration and intensity are commonly observed (1–3, 6).  Epidemiology of Past Pandemics    in the 20th century: the 1918 to 1919  pandemic (H1N1), the 1957 to 1958 pan-  demic (H2N2), and the 1968 pandemic  (H3N2) (1).

What is more certain is the phy- logenic origin of the virus, elucidated through sequencing of the virus found in human tissues preserved from 1918. Us- ing drift modeling, it appears that the ancestor virus first penetrated mamma- lian hosts (pigs) between 1882 and 1913, and the 1918 pandemic virus originated from a human/swine H1N1 reassortment event that led to an effective human transmission in approximately 1915 (16). However, the earliest reliable description of the 1918 pandemic influenza was in military camps during March 1918, al- though recent reports also suggest a first wave in New York in February to April 1918 (15). Most accounts suggest that this “first wave” had a relatively low inci- dence of nonsevere clinical disease with a limited spread. In August 1918, the dis- ease pattern suddenly changed, with widespread reports of severe influenza compatible clinical disease that emerged simultaneously in North America, Africa, and Europe (1). The global “second wave” peaked in October 1918, when school ab- senteeism was approximately 40% ac- cording to some reports (17). This wave was followed by a smaller “third wave” in February 1919 (17). Although the attack rates and age-specific incidence rates of this pandemic did not differ significantly Outbreaks of interpandemic influenza demic was characterized by its particu- larly high rates of morbidity and mortal- ity, especially among young adults (1, 17). The reason for the high mortality rates remain unclear, although recent analysis of genetic reconstruction of the 1918 strain suggest that the virus itself was more virulent and had a propensity to cause viral pneumonia, as well as a clinical picture compatible with a “cyto- kine storm” (1, 4, 18, 19). Controversy remains regarding whether the virus it- self, or its strong association with postvi- Three major pandemics were recorded ral bacterial pneumonia, was the majorcause of death in 1918 (19, 20). The over-all evidence today supports that bothmechanisms, direct viral virulence andpostviral superinfection, played majorroles in causing the high mortality. The exact molecular mechanisms behind the hypervirulence are not fully known, butin vitro genetic recombinants of H1N1 The geographic origin of the 1918 port an important role of the genes PB1,e3virus, the H3N2 virus appears to have originated from a reassortment between avian H3-containing viruses and the hu- man H2N2 (1).  Epidemiology of the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic   ports surfaced of an epidemic of severe influenza-like illness in various parts of Mexico and a report of influenza infection in three children in the southwest United States caused by an H1N1 strain of influ- enza closely related to domestic swine influenza (21). None of the children had exposure to swine, and sequencing of the isolated virus later confirmed that all the Mexican cases were caused by the same novel H1N1 strain. Although the misno- mer “swine flu” was initially used, the virus was clearly capable of human-to- human transmission and was later more appropriately named swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, human-adapted swine H1N1 influenza virus, novel H1N1, or 2009 H1N1 (contrasting it from 1918 H1N1).  Origins   niques and communication, the true geo- graphic origin of the novel H1N1 virus remains a mystery and is of limited rele- vance. Although the virus appears to have emerged first in Mexico (more specifically in San Luis Potosi) in late February 2009 (personal communication, Celia Alpuche, Mexican Institute of Diagnostic and Epi- demical Reference, Mexico City, Mexico), this likely represents the first large-scale transmission of this virus, which is readily supported by the nature of subse- quent global outbreaks, with initial cases having exposure or links to Mexico. How- ever, like the 1918 pandemic, the novel H1N1 strain or a similar swine-adapted virus may have been circulating at low levels among humans for months, or less likely years, before February 2009; it also may have been circulating among mam- mals (pigs) for years earlier. Molecular analysis suggests that the common an- cestor to the human 2009 pandemic H1N1 probably emerged in humans be- tween August 2008 and January 2009, whereas the nearest common ancestor in pigs has probably been circulating in pigs for at least a decade (22–24). Because worldwide pandemic influenza surveil- lance has focused on Asian avian strains,  e4  little work was performed to identify and type strains circulating in pigs, leading to the likelihood that a closely related an- cestor swine H1N1 virus existed long be- fore its emergence as a human-adapted strain in February 2009. Unlike other in- fluenza viruses, the genetic origin of this virus is better understood.

Although Eur- asian swine, North American swine, avian, and human components are in- cluded in the genome, these components were already present in ancestor triple reassortment swine viruses. Therefore, the virus certainly originated from pigs and has likely emerged as a result of reassortment between swine-adapted vi- ruses containing human and avian ele- ments (23). Lack of systematic swine sur- veillance allowed for the undetected persistence and evolution of this poten- tially pandemic strain to evolve for many years. Australia and 13 wks in New Zealand and 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: Descriptive Epidemiology of the “First Wave” tics could be accurately pinpointed. Despite modern epidemiologic tech- scribed in Mexico in April 2009 (26 –28). The first wave of the epidemic followed the course typical to influenza, with ex- ponentially increasing incidence from April 9 to April 24, peaking on April 26, and declining rapidly to effectively zero by May 25 (29). The duration of the first wave, therefore, was approximately 12 wks. The confirmed rate of infection was approximately five per 100,000 but is pre- sumably much higher in reality, because many individuals had subclinical disease and therefore were not tested (29). Age- specific incidence of confirmed cases was highest among children aged 0 to 14 yrs (29). Age-specific confirmed case mortal- ity of 55.7% suggested higher mortality rates among adults aged 30 to 59 yrs, although this case fatality rate is likely to have been grossly inflated by biased sam- pling (29). After World Health Organization notifi- cation of the increased incidence of influ- enza cases in Mexico, countries worldwide implemented enhanced surveillance. Sub- sequently, outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 were reported in Canada, the United States, the Middle East, East Asia, and Europe (30 – 32).

Although reference level serologic tests can differentiate between pandemic H1N1 and infection or vaccination with other H1N1 viruses, these are not practical or cost-effective to use outside of research settings. Estimates of attack rate and inci- dence can be made using epidemiologic techniques and mathematical modeling on the basis of epidemic curves. These are dis- cussed later.  Co-Circulation of Other Influenza Viruses   ruses is important for two reasons. When a single strain of influenza is circulating, anti-viral susceptibility is usually predict- able. For example, seasonal H3N2 strains  are widely susceptible to neuraminidase in- hibitors, whereas seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant (31). However, if co-circulation is occurring, it may be impossible to provide definitive therapy before genotyping. Sec- ond, when co-circulation is occurring, re- assortment between viruses is possible, po- tentially leading to new, more virulent, or more resistant viruses.  pandemic, the presence of co-circulating  Crit Care Med 2010 Vol. 38, No. 4 (Suppl.)gene confer resistance to these agents. Resistance to adamantanes is class-specific, whereas resistance to oseltamivir does not typically confer resistance to zanamivir (49). Surveillance is ongoing worldwide to detect the early development of resistance in the H1N1 2009 pandemic strain. To date, virtually all H1N1 2009 pandemic strains have been resistant to adamantanes (31). More than 10,000 viruses have been tested for resistance to oseltamivir worldwide and ⬍1% have been found to be resistant. As of October 14, 2009, 31 cases of oseltamivir- resistant H1N1 2009 infections have been reported, and all had the H275Y mutation conferring resistance (30, 31).

In the United States, where a second wave has begun, ⬎99% of circulating viruses are H1N1 2009 (31), and in Canada ⬎97% of influenza viruses circulating are H1N1 2009 as of mid-October (36). In the Southern Hemisphere, in countries out- side of the Americas, reports of co- circulation were more common during the first wave. Australia (40, 46), New Zealand (46, 47), and South Africa (46, 48) all reported significant co-circulation with H3N2 for significant parts of the first wave.

However, most cases resulting in hospitalization will be investigated and total laboratory-con- firmed influenza hospitalizations, ICU ad- missions, and deaths provide an epidemi- ologic surrogate for severe infections. By mid-September, Canada had recorded 1459 hospitalizations, of which 288 (19.7%) were ICU admissions and 76 (5.2%) resulted in death (30). Both ad- mission and, to a lesser extent, deaths were strongly associated with the influ- enza epidemic curve, accelerating in mid-  e6  cated infection. Overall illness with 2009 H1N1 seems to be in keeping with sea- sonal influenza, affecting primarily chil- dren and young adults, affecting males and females equally, and showing mini- mal predilection for people with underly- ing comorbidities. Contrary to that, se- vere illness shows a unique age, gender, and risk-factor predisposition (50 –53). The proportion of female patients af- fected, the median age, and the propor- tion of cases with underlying medical conditions increased with severity of ill- ness (Table 1). In a recent publication, 98.2% of critically ill patients with H1N1 2009 had at least one comorbidity (52). Those comorbidities most frequently re- ported were chronic lung disease (41.1%), obesity (33.3%), hypertension (24.4%), diabetes (20.8%), immunosup- pression (19.6%), neurologic disease (15.5%), cardiac disease other than hy- pertension (14.9%), and pregnancy (7.7%) (52). In addition, certain popula- tions, including aboriginals, were at high risk for severe disease in several countries (30, 39, 52). Age distribution of death also was not typical to interpandemic influ- enza. The age distribution of population- adjusted mortality in laboratory-con- firmed influenza H1N1 2009 is skewed to middle-aged individuals, rather than the very young and very old, creating a more W-shaped mortality curve reminiscent of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic (Fig. 2).Modeling the Next Wave To provide information on the impact of the second wave of influenza, models can be constructed using known charac- teristics of transmission (e.g., reproduc- tive number) and estimated rates of se- vere illness, ICU admissions, and deaths. One such model is presented here. The modeling component of this study is based on the design and use of a new deterministic compartmental model for June. Deaths were somewhat spread out across the epidemic, mostly as a result of intensive care practices and prolonged aggressive care before death (Fig. 1). Similar observations were noted in the United States, with 9079 hospital admis- sions by September 3, of which 593 (6.5%) resulted in death (31). viduals, latently infected individuals, in- Demographics and Risk Factors for Severe Infections viduals in the early stage (first 2 days) of The demographics of severe infection differ somewhat from those of uncompli-Crit Care Med 2010 Vol. 38, No. 4 (Suppl.)Figure 4.

The model is parameterized using ep- idemiologic and demographic data for the province of Manitoba, Canada, but should allow for approximate estimates to be ex- trapolated to other regions. For compar- ison, the population of Manitoba is ap- proximately 1.1 million. Main modeling assumptions include second wave begins first week of October 2009; high-risk individuals more likely to have severe illness develop, require hos- pitalization, and ICU admission in com- parison to low-risk individuals; mass vac- cination commences October 26, 2009 (vaccine efficacy ⬇80%); at least 10% to 20% of the total population have previous immunity (attributable to first-wave in- fection); first wave reproduction number is approximately 1.3, as reported by oth- ers (57– 60); and the R0 of the second wave is higher (1.9 before vaccine effect). Figure 3 depicts the time series of the number of hospitalized individuals; the scenario is that 10% of the total popula- tion are assumed to have infection- acquired immunity for various times when the vaccine impact takes effect. It is evident that the peak, which is expected to occur at the end of November or early December, increases with increasing du- ration of time before the vaccine impact is felt. Furthermore, the figure shows that the pandemic would run until late January or early February 2010. It also demonstrates dramatically the impact that timely vaccination can have on the course of the pandemic. Similar plots are depicted for the ICU admissions (Fig. 4) and H1N1-induced mortality (Fig. 5). This study estimates that where 10% of the total population has previous immu- nity, the province of Manitoba could have between 946 and 2223 hospitalizations, 194 and 459 ICU cases, and 45 and 108 H1N1-induced mortalities, depending on when the vaccine impact occurs. How- ever, simulating a similar scenario in which population immunity resulting from the first wave is higher at 20% pre- dicts a lower disease burden: 436 to 849 hospitalizations, 90 to 175 ICU admis- sions, and 21 to 41 deaths. In summary, this study projects that the burden of thesecond wave of the H1N1 pandemic could be at least three times that of the first not in the ICU, high-risk hospitalized indi- viduals in the ICU, low-risk hospitalized individuals in the ICU, and recovered indi- viduals. The model takes the form of the deterministic system of nonlinear differen- tial equations, similar to those for pan- demic avian influenza (54 –56).e7(39). The simulation results obtained are sensitive to changes in the parameters and initial values used, and although the simulations provide some idea of the out-  come of various scenarios, caution  should be used in interpreting the re-  sults.  CONCLUSION   21st century has provided us with insight into the fundamental epidemiologic char- acteristics of influenza and has afforded us a much greater understanding of the  impact of pandemic influenza on the  healthcare system and on individuals. Al- though the reasons for the enormous  variability of influenza pandemic severity  and spread remain elusive, it is certain that anunderstanding of the basic epide- miologic principles, pathophysiology, and natural history of this pandemic, as well as those of history, will serve to help all physicians—from the ICU to the hallways  of public health—provide the best possi-  ble individual and population-level inter-  ventions to reduce the impact of this  truly formidable pathogen. In addition to  presenting data on the impact of previous   pandemics and the first wave of the current  pandemic, we also have used a determinis-  tic compartmental model for the transmis-  sion dynamics of H1N1 in the population to  predict the impact of the next wave. Our  predictions suggest that vaccination and   existing natural immunity from the first  wave will have a significant impact on the  disease and severe disease incidence and that the peak is likely to occur approxi- mately in early December 2009. The wave is expected to last into early 2010.   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   Podder and O. Sharomi in helping with  simulations, and we thank S. Mahmud for useful comments on model design.   "

Since the beginning of the 21st century, cases have risen dramatically, most notably in Mexico and Brazil, where outbreaks occur in urban centers including cities with populations of > 1,000,000 persons. Reported case fatality rates can exceed 50%. Factors consistent with high case fatality include lack of awareness of disease ecology, limited capacity for diagnosis, and delay in appropriate antimicrobial treatment. The emergence of urban hyperendemic foci has been leveraged by 2 distinct but similar anthropogenic events that create disproportionately high numbers of vertebrate amplifiers of R rickettsii, as well as the tick species that transmit this pathogen in proximity with dense human populations. This often occurs in neighborhoods with a highly marginalized at-risk population that includes persons in poverty and particularly children, and health management systems that are under-resourced. We discuss strategies to reduce host dog populations, particularly in Mexico, and capybaras in Brazil. We review challenges to the control of tick populations in these settings. Robust systems are required to enhance awareness of RMSF among medical practitioners and people at risk of RMSF. Public health campaigns should incorporate innovative behavioral science (eg, diverse learning models, motivational interviews, and gamification) to increase prevention and under- standing within communities. While anti-Rickettsia or anti-tick vaccines will be necessary to resolve this One Health crisis, impactful implementation will require data-driven and multiple-target innovations to address challenges with hosts, ticks, medical systems, and public welfare.

Nonetheless, the frequency of infection with R rickettsii in Dermacentor spp in sylvatic settings is typically quite low: historically even in relatively high incidence regions such as the Bitterroot Valley, Herein, we apply a One Health focus to character- 0.3% to 1.9%.21,22 Sylvatic ecologies for RMSF also exist in regions of Latin America where R rickettsii is endemic. From 2005 to 2007 among rural families in the state of Yucatan, Mexico, there were at least 10 cases, mostly in children.23 People reportedly “living in poor condi- tions” were exposed to family gardens and orchids, which suggests harborage for certain ticks and hosts, particularly the Amblyomma parvum vector.24 Cases in Veracruz in the 1940s may have been sylvatic, with the “Amblyomma cajennense” complex (likely Amblyomma mixtum) as the implicated vector.25 Across rural Colombia and Panama, R rickettsii has also been detected in Dermacentor nitens, a synan- thropic species that mainly parasitizes horses,26 and For more than 100 years after its first descrip- host tropisms to include wildlife and humans.12,27 In3Unauthenticated | Downloaded 07/02/25 08:57 PM UTCFigure 2—Clinical characteristics of RMSF in dogs can include lethargy and depression (A), arthralgia and lameness (B), conjunctival edema and episcleral injection (C), petechial exanthem of oral mucosae (D), orchitis and scrotal edema (E), and peripheral gangrene (F).

Many residents in these communities live in poverty and have minimal or non- existent access to animal wellness and vector control services.29 These communities are typically remote,  4NANAwith low human population density, but nonethe- less maintain hyperendemic levels of RMSF. Here, the risk of disease is greatest among children, with 33% of cases in people < 18 years old. Dogs are key- stone hosts for all feeding stages of Rhipicephalus Peridomestic circulation of R rickettsii occurs feed on other hosts, including humans, particularly at elevated ambient temperatures.30 Experimental infections of dogs suggest that once infected, they remain rickettsemic and can transmit R rickettsii to feeding ticks for as long as 7 days.31 Dogs therefore serve both as amplifying hosts for the pathogen and principal hosts for the vector, creating enormous numbers of ticks, including infected ticks at the Community-level RMSF emerged in tribal lands In Brazil, Rocky Mountain spotted fever was first identified in 1929 in the state of São Paulo,33 but it now occurs in multiple distinct ecologies.7 Community- level RMSF is transmitted by A aureolatum, a tick nor- mally maintained by crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous). However, the disturbed Atlantic rainforest patches, interspersed with the urban matrix, noAJVRUnauthenticated | Downloaded 07/02/25 08:57 PM UTClonger support wild carnivores. The poorest people are at greatest risk for RMSF, living near large num- bers of free-roaming or stray dogs that maintain and amplify A aureolatum.34–36 Amblyomma aureolatum is not typically aggressively human-feeding; however, ticks that have pre-fed on dogs activate R rickettsii in their salivary glands, and can then rapidly transmit to human hosts.37 Most cases in the A aureolatum ecol- ogy occur in children due to close, frequent contact with dogs.38 There are anecdotal reports of cases in children associated with contact with domestic cats, which also frequent the surrounding forests and can become infested with A aureolatum. Relevant socio- economic factors are that these poorer populations do not have the resources for tick preventive prod- ucts on dogs. There also is a constant renewal of the dog population in these areas, both due to deficien- cies in population control and high rates of abandon- ment of dogs in the area.35,36  rural areas and involved boys and men employed as agricultural workers.39 Four outbreaks reported from 2003 to 2008 had CFRs of 30%.40 Reservoir hosts for RMSF transmitted by A mixtum in Central America have not been confirmed. There are well-documented outbreaks of RMSF in Costa Rica, totaling 18 cases from 1975 to 2011 with a CFR of 83.3% (Table 1).41 There has been little recent literature on RMSF in Costa Rica, with the exception of a case report published in 2019.42 In Panama the CFR of RMSF approaches 90%,43,44 and cases are both rural and urban. The potential vectors A mixtum and Rhipicephalus san- guineus sl are widely distributed in Panama, which suggests the risk of additional unrecognized cases.12 Distributions of both tick species may expand with ongoing alteration of native forests and decline of biodiversity, while cases may continue to emerge with increased ecotourism, hunting, logging, expan- sion of human settlements into adjacent wilderness areas, and roaming animals in cities.12 Of particular concern is a case series in Panama of 7 people includ- ing 4 fatalities in a remote indigenous community, which may reflect underlying health disparities.43  RMSF associated with Rhipicephalus sanguin- eus sl. Sinaloa and Sonora states had more than 200 sporadic and rural cases from as early as 1918 and then a reemergence in the latter 20th century1,3,23 (and many others). The earliest CFRs ranged from 27 to 80%45 and occurred in homes where dogs were typically infested with Rhipicephalus sanguineus sl.46 During the late 20th century and early 2000s, there were small case clusters in Yucatan associated with Rhipicephalus sanguineus sl.47 Cases and outbreaks continue to occur in towns across Baja California (Mexicali Valley and San Quintin), a small community of 35,000 people west of Hermosillo in Sonora, and many other villages and towns as well.48–50  Urban RMSF  RMSF in large urban centers, including San Jose in Costa Rica, São Paulo in Brazil, and Mexicali, Tijuana,  AJVR    Ensenada, Hermosillo, and Ciudad Juarez in Mexico (Table 1).7,8,32,48,51–54 Cases in Costa Rica in 2003, 2010, and 2011 were within cities,41,55 while cases in 1987 were reported from an urbanized area near for- est in the north56; these urban cases are likely to have been acquired from Rhipicephalus sanguineus sl. The presence of this highly fatal disease in large cities is of enormous concern, as underlying social and eco- logical factors allow infected ticks to spread rapidly among homes in these densely populated areas. Urban epidemic Brazilian RMSF is associated with A sculptum populations sustained by capybaras,54,57 exemplified in Figure 3. In southeastern Brazil, a total of 1471 RMSF cases were laboratory confirmed from 2013 to 2023, of which 667 (45%) were fatal (Table 1). More than half of the cases are in the state of São Paulo, followed by Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Espírito Santo.9,54 Urban and peridomiciliary exposure accounts for 35% of all Brazilian RMSF.9 Most of the earliest Costa Rican cases occurred in generalist that readily bites humans59 and feeds extensively on horses (Equus caballus), capybaras, and tapirs (Tapirus terrestris).60 Horses serve to spread ticks but are not amplifying hosts for R rick- ettsii.61 In contrast, capybaras sustain huge popula- tions of A sculptum in RMSF-endemic areas and are amplifying hosts for R rickettsii,58 which contributes to high RMSF burdens in regions where capybaras are abundant.62 Amblyomma sculptum is partially refractory to R rickettsii infection with transovarial transmission rates < 50%, resulting in overall infection rates < 1% among A sculptum populations in the RMSF-endemic areas.63 This situation means that the establishment of R rickettsii in A sculptum populations is directly dependent on large tick populations and a constant source of amplifying hosts. Because capybaras are semiaquatic grazing rodents that live close to water, persons at greatest risk for RMSF in urban settings are those who frequent areas close to lakes, rivers, and other watercourses for work or leisure activities. Most cases of RMSF have been reported in adult men (who in this area are more likely to access areas with Many Mexican villages suffer community-level Capybaras are tolerant of human presence and have expanded in range and numbers with defores- tation and encroaching agriculture, including into urban and suburban parks, golf courses, university campuses, and large swaths of cattle ranches and cropland, especially in sugar cane, corn, and rice fields and where predators have been eliminated.64 Their abundant supply of food in RMSF-endemic areas (eg, sugar cane and corn crops, irrigated grasses), ability to thrive even on marginal-quality diets, and social structure of large groups of 40 or more individuals support a high reproduction rate, high population renewal, and capacity for population size increase.65 In Mexico, urban epidemics are maintained by free-roaming stray dogs and Rhipicephalus sanguin- There is recent and ominous hyperendemic number of cases and deaths with 2,160 cases con- firmed from 2004 to 2023 and 596 deaths, half of5Unauthenticated | Downloaded 07/02/25 08:57 PM UTCFigure 3—Tick vectors and ecological characteris- tics of endemic settings for RMSF in São Paulo State, Brazil.

Culling of free-roaming dogs has been employed in some countries to address outbreaks of canine-associated zoonoses70 although culling is extremely unpopular among the public. The WHO discourages culling in favor of licensing, public education, and fertility control.71 Culling can contrib- ute to changes in behavior (including aggressiveness) and social and territorial behavior (often increasing contact rates).72 Reduced population size temporar- ily increases population growth rates and increases the proportion of the population that is susceptible to disease. Restraining dogs more successfully reduces disease and other dog-related problems.  efforts across 15 countries found the greatest impact is achieved through fertility control.73 For some spe- cies, a trap-neuter-release strategy could fill available niche space with neutered individuals, potentially reducing the population growth rate to zero. However, the carrying capacity for dog populations is largely set by human decisions such as providing food resources, buying or adopting dogs, and allow- ing dogs to roam. Trap-neuter-release is resource intensive, requiring trained personnel. However, it promotes an older, more disease-resistant popula- tion. Dogs that were infected previously with less virulent spotted fever group rickettsiae, such as R massiliae, contribute to herd immunity.74 In the A aureolatum–infested dogs in São Paulo, spay and neuter efforts and education programs address- ing responsible ownership are challenged by the continuous abandonment of dogs.36  with capybara abundance.62,75 Although often pro- tected by law, capybaras may be hunted for meat and hides and increasingly for population manage- ment, in part to protect public health. However, this culling may largely promote population turn- over unless done very aggressively. One study75 in an RMSF-endemic park area in southeastern Brazil demonstrated that culling the entire population of capybaras eliminated A sculptum population in 2 years75 but required that the residential park be completely fenced (including streams that flowed into and out of the area), preventing colonization by nearby capybaras.

Acaricide may not perme- ate deeply enough, roaming dogs can repeatedly reintroduce ticks, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sl can climb walls, actively migrating between semide- tached houses.79 Some folk remedies (eg, garlic, flea spray, and herbal remedies) have no efficacy for tick control, yet even correctly used acaricides may fail to control Rhipicephalus sanguineus sl due to acari- cide resistance.80 Resistance has been documented A meta-analysis of canine population control cypermethrin, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, cou- maphos, amitraz, and chlorpyriphos-methyl.81–91 Oral isoxazolines are effective against ticks as is the combination of flumethrin and imidacloprid deliv- ered by collar. However, cost and limited availability challenge use in some homes and scalability for larger control. Acaricides are part of integrated approaches along with aligning residents’ and health workers’ expectations with the difficulty of the task, repeated and regular interventions, and postapplication assess- ments of efficacy. Other tick control measures such as sealing cracks and crevices can be helpful. 78 Controlling populations of A sculptum and A mixtum remains challenging due to broad host ranges, and capybaras are difficult to handle to apply any product. Automatic devices to apply acaricides to capybaras are hindered by their semiaquatic behav- ior and unintended risk of environmental damage. In Amblyomma sculptum abundance is associated are sustained by horses, and in those areas, environ- mental control of the ticks can be achieved through pyrethroid acaricides on horses92 and vegetation management. There are reports of A mixtum from Mexico and A sculptum from Brazil with resistance to amidines and pyrethroids.93–95 Integrated vector management can include creating environmental buffer zones, managing landscaping, and encour- aging personal protection.96 Pasture management, mowing grass close to the soil and yearly summer reforming of pasture leaves ovipositing A sculptum and their egg masses vulnerable to the changed soil microclimate.97Prospects for control with vaccines An effective vaccine against R rickettsii, a vaccine that inhibits feeding of the tick, or both could dra- Fertility control appears to be the most feasible Vaccinating amplifying hosts could reduce overall7Unauthenticated | Downloaded 07/02/25 08:57 PM UTCtick numbers and R rickettsii–infected ticks.

The BM86 vaccine protects cattle from Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp ticks by stimulating anti-Boophilus spp antibodies that reduce tick fecundity and survival.100 However, genetic variability in the gene reduces universal efficacy. A crude tick gut extract showed slight effi- cacy against Rhipicephalus sanguineus sl in dogs.101 Numerous other target proteins such as aquaporin and subolesin show efficacy above 50%.102  Epidemiological calculations such as those used for rabies103 can predict the proportion of the popula- tion that must be vaccinated against Rickettsia spp to achieve herd immunity based on data on population turnover and the basic reproduction number (Roo). Logically, achieving control of Rhipicephalus sanguin- eus sl with an anti-tick vaccine on dogs would require almost 100% vaccination rates, because unvaccinated dogs could otherwise contaminate the environment with ticks. These same considerations apply to capy- baras, with additional complications of darting and capturing them or creating an oral bait delivery system.  Protecting people against RMSF  need to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy within the first 4 to 5 days, is the principal risk factor for a fatal outcome.1,32 It is crucial to educate clini- cians about RMSF in their region and that treatment should be based entirely on clinical acumen.7,104 This requires that human and veterinary medical and vec- tor professionals track local cases, exchange infor- mation, and promote public awareness about RMSF. Public awareness is crucial regardless of dog owner- ship, as cases of RMSF in households without dogs can occur because of roaming dogs or ticks moving from neighboring properties.48,52  content is delivered too infrequently or messaging lacks impact.105 We should consider novel behavioral science and strategies of education such as environ- mental education for children, diverse learning mod- els, motivational interviews, diffusion of innovation,  social media, social marketing, gamification, and other cutting-edge techniques.  information dissemination in protecting the public   8    against RMSF. In late 2023, the CDC issued an RMSF health alert regarding the newly emerging RMSF in Tecate, Mexico, with the spillover of fatal cases in the US. Yet, 2 years earlier, our team had found PCR-positive dogs in the local animal shelter, and epidemics were raging in nearby Mexicali and Tijuana.106 In 2024, a series of 7 pediatric cases were reported in San Diego, CA, with travel or residence in Mexico; despite a very high standard of care, 2 were discharged with persistent neurological disease.107 Despite the urgency, rigorous evaluation of RMSF intervention campaigns is rare. In Arizona, comprehensive intervention in small tribal towns Anti-tick vaccines could allow for reduced (on dogs and around homes), dog spay/neuter, and encouraging restraint of dogs to property.108,109 Outcomes of tick numbers and cases were favor- able but required ongoing highly resource-intensive intervention. A similar campaign was undertaken in a heavily affected area in Sonora. Compared to a control area, there was a significant decrease in tick infestation of dogs and no human RMSF cases.49,50 Importantly, however, it is unknown which specific components of the interventions were most impact- ful or critical. Because of this, we have developed an Vaccination campaigns face multiple challenges. tion.110 Another novel, intervention in Sonora that reduced Rhipicephalus sanguineus sl was paint with microencapsulated, slow-release pesticide.49Summary Anthropogenic and ecological circumstances that create disproportionately high numbers of amplifying hosts of R rickettsii, coupled with massive peridomestic populations of vector tick species, have resulted in hyperendemic levels of RMSF in many communities and cities in multiple countries of the Americas, particularly in Latin America. Managing these vertebrate amplifying host species is a key part of integrated control and preventive programs Limited knowledge about RMSF, particularly the challenges, but integrated pest management, the promise of effective canine vaccines, and other inno- vations are needed to mitigate the burden of RMSF. Most fatal cases stem from a lack of awareness of the disease among clinicians and the public that results in delays in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment. In many areas where the burden of RMSF is greatest, most at-risk people are highly marginalized. This aspect of urban and com- munity-level RMSF must also be addressed to effec- tively reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this life-threatening disease.

Armstrong2*‡NA Borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GeorgiaAbstract. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, is a severe and potentially fatal tick- borne disease. In 2015, Mexico issued a declaration of epidemiologic emergency in response to ongoing outbreaks of RMSF in northern Mexico. Sonora state is one of the most heavily impacted states in Mexico, with historic case fatality rates (CFRs) of 18%. We summarized data from enhanced surveillance to understand demographic, clinical, and treat- ment factors associated with the high mortality. We conducted a retrospective review of conﬁrmed and probable RMSF cases reported to the General Directorate of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention in Sonora. A case of RMSF is deﬁned as fever (> 38.5°C), plus two symptoms, and epidemiologic criteria. A conﬁrmed case requires laboratory evi- dence. During 2015–2018, a total of 510 cases of RMSF were reported; 252 (49%) were in persons aged £ 18 years. Case fatality rate was 44% (n = 222). Older age and being conﬁrmed by PCR were associated with fatal outcome (P-value < 0.01). The mean time from onset of symptoms to treatment with doxycycline was 7.9 days (SD ± 5.5). Hot spot analysis revealed neither areas of inordinately high nor low incidence, rather clusters of disease in population centers. The CFR for RMSF in Sonora remains high, and a large proportion of cases are seen in persons aged £ 18 years. Whereas previously children experienced a disproportionately high CFR, interventions have reversed this trend. Disease clusters in urban nuclei, but location remains a predictor of fatal outcome.NAINTRODUCTION pain, coagulopathy, altered mental status, and shock in as few Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a severe and po- patients and typically develops between days 2 and 4 of ill- ness; late onset rash is associated with increased mortality because of delay in treatment.12–15 Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for all age-groups, and recent studies have shown that doxycycline does not cause tooth staining in pediatric populations.1,16,17 After decades of quiescence, RMSF re-emerged in northern Mexico, a historically endemic region, in the early 2000s.18,19 Sonora is one of the most impacted states in northern Mexico, with 1,394 cases reported during the period 2003–2016, and a historic case fatality rate (CFR) of 18%.20 In 2015, because of an increase in cases and deaths in several states of northern Mexico, El Centro Nacional de Programas Preventivos y Rhipicephalus sanguineus is capable of infesting dogs in Ministry of Health (MOH) issued a declaration of epidemiologic emergency for RMSF, which was updated in 2018.21 In re- sponse to the growing case counts and high CFR, Sonora began an enhanced epidemiologic surveillance program to collect comprehensive information on clinical presentation, treatment, and diagnosis of RMSF in the state. We summa- rized the data to better understand the emergence, changing trends, and reasons for the high mortality rates associated with RMSF in northern Mexico. The initial stages of RMSF can be difﬁcult to distinguishMATERIALS AND METHODS Data collection. We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of RMSF reported to the Dirección General de Promoción a la Salud y Prevención de Enfermedades (DGPROSPE) during January 2015–December 2018. Pro- viders completed the National Surveillance Case Report Form at the time of initial contact and collected data including de-mographics, exposure, and detailed clinical information. In the event, a patient was unable to provide information; the190reporting providers completed the information to the best of their ability, typically with the assistance of a family member or accompanying relative. Additional laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were added retrospectively through epidemiologic follow-up. We analyzed all raw data from the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Rickettsial Dis- eases from the Sonora MOH. Geographic coordinates of cases were available and incorporated into the analysis. To calculate incidence rates, we used the most recently available National Institute of Geography and Statistics census data from 2010. The Sonora MOH has classiﬁed the state into six health jurisdictions: Hermosillo (1) is located centrally; Caborca (2), Santa Ana (3), and San Luis Rio Colorado (6) are in the north; and Ciudad Obregon (4) and Navojoa (5) are located in the southern portion of the state. Case fatality rates were calculated for each jurisdiction. The following seasonal categories were used for analysis: winter (December–February), spring (March–May), summer (June– August), and autumn (September–November).  as abrupt onset of fever (> 38.5°C), plus at least two of the following clinical features: headache, rash, myalgia, malaise, meningismus, hemorrhage, purpura, hyponatremia, leukocy- tosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated hepatic trans- aminases, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and shock. Cases must also satisfy one of the following epidemiologic criteria: 1) history of tick bite or contact with tick-infested dog in the 2 weeks preceding onset of symptoms, 2) ticks present in or around the house, or 3) travel to or residing in a neighborhood with an identiﬁed case of RMSF within the previous 6-month period. A conﬁrmed case requires one of the following labo- ratory ﬁndings: 1) R. rickettsii DNA detected in a whole blood sample via PCR assay, or 2) single IgM or IgG antibody titer of ³ 1:64 reactive to R. rickettsii antigen by indirect immuno- ﬂuorescence antibody assay (IFA). A case is considered probable if the clinical criteria are satisﬁed, but no conﬁrma- tory laboratory evidence is available. All conﬁrmed and prob- able cases were included in this analysis.  responding 95% CIs and P-values were calculated for all variables to assess association with fatal outcome. Categor- ical data are presented as proportions and compared using Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test when any cell contained fewer than ﬁve observations, as appropriate. Nor- mally distributed continuous variables are presented as means (SDs) and compared using Student’s t-test, whereas nonnormally distributed continuous variables are presented as medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]) and compared using the Mann–Whitney/Wilcoxon two-sample test, as appropri- ate. Two-sided statistical tests were considered signiﬁcant at α = 0.05. All data analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).  (ESRI, Redlands, CA). Pie charts were made proportionate to the number of cases represented, and fatal and nonfatal cases were represented for each jurisdiction. In addition, optimized hot spot analysis in Getis-Ord Gi* was used to identify hot spots of disease. This analysis identiﬁes an appropriate geo- graphic scale of analysis and clusters of disease by de- termining where a feature (e.g., municipalities) with a high value is surrounded by other features with lower values.  EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL FEATURES OF RMSF, SONORA, MEXICOEthics statement. All data were previously collected for national surveillance purposes and was de-identiﬁed and aggregated. As such, a full ethical review was deemed un- necessary by both institutions.RESULTSDemographics and exposure. During 2015–2018, a total of 510 cases of RMSF were reported; 432 (85%) were con- ﬁrmed and 78 (15%) were probable (Table 1). Of all case pa- tients, 263 (52%) were male and 23 (5%) self-identiﬁed as part of indigenous communities. The median age was 19 (IQR: 10–42) years. Case patients were further stratiﬁed by age- group with the highest number of reported cases occurring in children aged 8–18 years (n = 174; 34%) and adults aged 36–64 (n = 145; 28%) years. During the study period, the highest proportion of cases reported illness onset in 2015 (n = 180, 35%); 85 (48%) were fatal (Figure 1). Cases were distributed throughout all months Case deﬁnition. The Sonora MOH deﬁnes a case of RMSF August (n = 56, 11%), September (n = 63, 12%), and October (n = 64, 13%) (Figure 2). When characterized by geographical location, Hermosillo (Jurisdiction 1) reported the largest number of cases (n = 214, 42%), followed by Ciudad Obregon (Jurisdiction 4; n = 141, 28%) and Navojoa (Jurisdiction 5; n = 107, 21%) (Figure 3). Exposure to ticks (n = 407, 80%) and contact with dogs (n = 452, 89%) were reported in most cases. Few cases (n = 29, 7%) reported recent history of unusual dog death. More than half (60%) of cases reported the triad of fever, rash, and tick exposure (Table 1). Clinical and laboratory ﬁndings. Fever was reported by all cases as required by the case deﬁnition. The most common clinical symptoms were headache (93%), myalgia (90%), mild to moderate arthralgia (79%), rash (67%), and nausea (57%) (Table 2).

Sixty-three percent (n = 323) of all cases were diagnosed by PCR, 21% (n = 109) were diagnosed by IFA, and 78 (15%) did not have laboratory results.

All age-groups experienced CFRs greater than 25%; the age-group with the highest fa- tality rate was case patients aged 65 years or older (67%), followed by 36–64 years (58%). The CFR was lowest (27%) for those aged < 8 years.

How- ever, current data show this has declined, and in our study, this age-group had the lowest CFR among all age-groups. The decrease in CFR among children may be attributed to inter- ventions by local health authorities in Sonora such as 1) availability of intravenous doxycycline in hospitals, 2) clinical education targeting early recognition and treatment, 3) en- hanced epidemiological surveillance to understand gaps in DISCUSSION and 5) community health promotion programs focused on Rocky Mountain spotted fever remains a prominent threat in dogs.23 By contrast, the high CFR among individuals aged ³ 65 years may be attributable to comorbid conditions and less concerted effort by providers to consider RMSF in the differential for an adult patient presenting with febrile illness. It is also possible that these individuals are less familiar withNA TABLE 2 Clinical ﬁndings: Cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever—Sonora, Mexico 2015–2018 Nonfatal Overall casesSign/symptom510 (100) 473 (93) 460 (90) 402 (79) 342 (67) 288 (57) 243 (48) 222 (44) 127 (25) 77 (20) 82 (16) 81 (16) 53 (10) 50 (10) 47 (9) 44 (9) 43 (8) 39 (8) 35 (7) 32 (6) 27 (5)White blood cell count (×103 cells/mL) Neutrophils (%) Hemoglobin (g/dL) Hematocrit (%) Platelet count (×103 platelets/mL) Sodium (mEq/L) Creatinine (mEq/L) Serum glutamic oxaloacetic   Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase/  Total bilirubin (mg/dL)    RMSF, given its only recent emergence in the community, and thus less likely to perceive ticks as high risk.24  laboratory values among adults, we found certain results to be helpful and of clinical utility in predicting fatal outcome.25,26 A study conducted in an Arizona tribal community found that laboratory results did not differ between conﬁrmed RMSF cases and non-conﬁrmed cases.26 Another study among the same population found only elevated liver function tests to be helpful in predicting fatal outcome.27 In this study, we add that the presence of severe thrombocytopenia and elevated         Age-group (years)      Gender   Jurisdiction       Season of onset     Ethnicity    Case deﬁnition   Diagnostic method     Ref = reference group.

Time from symptom onset to seeking care was longer than that in previous studies and represents an opportunity for in- creased community education and awareness.26 Treatment is most effective within the ﬁrst 5 days of illness; because most patients sought care on or after day 5 of illness, even prompt recognition and treatment by healthcare providers may not beNA TABLE 4 Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever—Sonora, Mexico 2015–2018 Overall treatedN = 444 (87%)NA <8 8–18 19–35 36–64 > 65Male FemaleHermosillo Caborca Santa Ana Ciudad Obregon Navojoa San Luis Rio ColoradoDecember–February March–May June–August September–NovemberIndigenous Nonindigenous UnknownConﬁrmed ProbablePCR Immunoﬂuorescence antibody assay Clinical symptomsNA 196   effective at reducing mortality. However, treatment was also frequently delayed 3–4 days after initial healthcare contact. This undoubtedly contributes to the high mortality seen among RMSF case patients in Sonora and demonstrates a need for continued education among providers, especially in endemic areas of key importance.  CFR. Cases are most numerous in urban centers likely be- cause of the larger population at risk. Interestingly, the hot spot analysis revealed that when adjusting for population size at the level of the municipality, there were neither areas of particularly high nor low incidence. Geography became more signiﬁcant in relation to CFR, with the lowest appreciated in Jurisdiction 1 and the highest in Jurisdictions 4 and 5 located in the southern portion of the state. It is also notable that de- spite similar sociodemographic conditions, climate, and comparable populations of free-roaming dogs, the CFR in Sonora is six times higher than that in tribal regions in the United States.26 Factors that may contribute to dispropor- tionately high CFRs both in Sonora and within the state are delay in clinical diagnosis and access to care. Such ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies conducted in different regions.2,25 When comparing with Sonora’s other health ju- risdictions, Hermosillo’s lower CFR may be due to overall better socioeconomic conditions, improved provider educa- tion and awareness, and access to health care. By contrast, the south of Sonora experiences higher rates of social depri- vation and a more rural distribution of the population.28 These can all contribute to difﬁculty accessing medical care, poor provider awareness, and delayed treatment.20  outcome than cases conﬁrmed by serology. Although ele- vated serologic titers can reﬂect past exposure, PCR conﬁr- mation is more indicative of the etiology of the current infection. Our results conﬁrm those with PCR conﬁrmation had a higher CFR; however, the CFR of 49% seen in this co- hort exceeds the pre-doxycycline era. This suggests that additional factors are contributing to an inordinately high CFR; these can include pathogen (e.g., virulent strain), vector (e.g.,  brown dog tick), host (e.g., malnutrition), or biased sampling (e.g., surveillance capture of severe cases). Treatment should be initiated based on clinical suspicion and should not be  delayed awaiting diagnostic conﬁrmation. Because speci- mens for cases conﬁrmed by PCR were collected at a mean of  5.3 days, this highlights the importance of education providers to begin treatment when suspecting RMSF and not to await conﬁrmatory diagnostic results.  evenly distributed throughout the year, but CFR was highest during March. Because we also observed the highest pro- portion of untreated cases in winter, we suspect other etiol- ogies were being considered more highly, such as inﬂuenza or  respiratory syncytial virus infection. Providers may also have misconceptions about the seasonality of RMSF, attributing highest risk to spring and summer months.29 However, warmer temperatures (³ 43°F), such as those in Sonora, in- crease winter activity of ticks, maintaining a high rate of ex-  posure even during the winter months.30 Providers in these areas should consider RMSF in their differential diagnosis even in the winter months.  formed with more frequency on more severe cases as they  ÁLVAREZ-LÓPEZ, OCHOA-MORA, AND OTHERSNA may present for higher levels of care where molecular testing is more readily available. The current case deﬁnition allows a single titer of 1:64 to be sufﬁcient evidence to conﬁrm a case. This may represent previous exposure to any one of the spotted fever group Rickettsiae and may not be indicative of RMSF, placing more signiﬁcance on the ﬁndings seen for Geographic location was notable in both prevalence and sents a more active approach to surveillance than standard laboratory-based pass surveillance, it is still likely we detected more severe cases, and this may underrepresent burden and overrepresent the most severe disease. Conversely, the probable case deﬁnition which relies on symptoms alone may be overly broad and not speciﬁc. Only 15% of cases were included on the basis of clinical criteria alone, so we feel this represents a small portion of the data. Last, missing data may bias the results and interpretation of trends. The data captured through enhanced surveillance in Sonora provide reassuring evidence that education and targeted campaigns are effective in reversing disparities in CFR in pe- diatric populations. Treatment data also show more children are receiving the recommended doxycycline and that heightened awareness in adult populations is needed. It is concerning to see higher CFRs in areas of poverty and poorer access to care, and these should be targeted through addi- tional training and education efforts. Our data also demon- strate a very signiﬁcant ﬁnding that all populations are at equal risk for acquiring the disease, yet multiple modiﬁable factors can predict disposition.Received July 14, 2020.

He also showed that infected ticks could transmit the disease transovarially to their oﬀspring.14–16 Tragically, this talented rickettsiologist was aﬀected by epidemic typhus and died in 1910, at the age of 39 years.17 Soon afterward, E R Le Count described the fundamental histopathology ﬁnding (ie, the vascular lesion) of RMSF.18 In 1919, S Burt Wolbach published an extensive study on the agent of RMSF, conﬁrming that ticks carried the bacterium.19 He also noted the intracellular nature of the pathogen, which principally infected endothelial cells. Wolbach named the agent of RMSF as Dermacentroxenus rickettsii in honour of Howard T Ricketts. The use of the generic term Dermacentroxenus derived from the generic name of the tick vector, Dermacentor andersoni. However, the genus Dermacentroxenus was not universally accepted, and then rapidly uniﬁed with the genus Rickettsia,NA http://infection.thelancet.com Vol 7 November 2007previously.35–37 Data from rickettsiae genomics are likely to improve the current understanding of the mechanism of rickettsial pathogenicity,38 and may help the development of new diagnostic tools and vaccines.17 The unpublished complete genome sequence of R rickettsii (size 1 257 710 bp) has recently been deposited in GenBank (accession number AADJ01000001). The complete genomes of ﬁve Rickettsia  spp (R bellii, R conorii, R felis, R prowazekii, and R typhi) and the unﬁnished genomes of another six (R africae, R akari, R canadensis, R massiliae, R sibirica, and R slovaca) are also available in the GenBank database.  Natural reservoir hosts and mode of transmission Natural reservoirs of R rickettsii include hard ticks (family Ixodidae; ﬁgure 1) of various genera and species.39 The pathogen is maintained in nature, across several tick generations, through transovarial passage (from an infected female tick to her progeny) and transstadial passage (between developmental life stages). Although R rickettsii can also be found in domestic (eg, dogs) and wild mammals, the role of these animals as reservoirs of infection is not well understood.17,39–43 Some of these animals may serve as secondary reservoirs or amplifying hosts.44  is the primary vector of R rickettsii in most of the USA.

The brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus; ﬁgure 3), thought to be the primary vector of R rickettsii in Mexico,45 has recently been implicated in the transmission of the pathogen in eastern Arizona.46 Although the role of Rh sanguineus as a vector of R rickettsii has been determined in the laboratory,47 it has a low aﬃnity for human beings.31 However, human http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ parasitism by Rh sanguineus may be more common than previously recognised,48 and this tick may eventually act as a vector of R rickettsii in other areas where the infection is endemic.17 The Cayenne tick (Amblyomma cajennense), which is thought to be a common vector of R rickettsii in Central and South America,9 has a high aﬃnity for human beings,31 and has been found naturally infected with R rickettsii in Panama and Brazil.49–51 The tick Amblyomma aureolatum, commonly known in Brazil as carrapato- amarelo-do-cão (the yellow dog tick), has recently been implicated as a vector for R rickettsii in Brazil.52 Other tick species are suspected to be involved in the transmission of R rickettsii.53–55 However, some of these tick species seldom bite human beings. Most of the reports on natural infection of ticks with rickettsial agents are based on techniques that are not able to distinguish the The American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis; ﬁgure 2), the haemolymph test, were (and are still) widely used because of their low cost and simplicity. When assessing the role of a given tick species as a vector of R rickettsii, the Ticks presence of confounding organisms (eg, R felis, R bellii, Class Arachnida R amblyommii, R parkeri, R prowazekii, and R massiliae)56–61 should not be ignored. Thus, the use of techniques (eg, PCR ampliﬁcation and sequencing) that could accurately identify the Rickettsia spp involved is highly desirable. R rickettsii is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick, which acts as both reservoir and vector of the pathogen. When the tick is attached to and feeding on a human Soft ticks being, a reactivation phenomenon takes place and Argasidae highly pathogenic one. This process requires a minimum period of attachment that often ranges from 4 h to 6 h, although it may be as long as 24 h.11,62,63 There is also a possibility of acquiring R rickettsii infection by contact with tick tissues or ﬂuids, by inhalation of contaminated aerosol (reported only in laboratories),64 or through blood transfusion.65 Particular care needs to be taken when removing ticks to avoid contact with tick tissues or ﬂuids.Epidemiology The geographical distribution of RMSF is restricted to countries of the western hemisphere (ﬁgure 4). The disease has been found in the USA, western Canada,66 western and central Mexico,67,68 Panama,69 Costa Rica,70 northwestern Argentina,71 Brazil (states of São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Bahia, and Santa Catarina),51 and Colombia.72 In the USA, RMSF occurs in all contiguous48 states, except for Vermont and Maine;73,74 half of the cases are found in Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Arkansas,NA 725Figure 3: Dorsal view of a male Rhipicephalus sanguineus Photo courtesy of the CDC Public Health Image Library/James Gathany/William Nicholson.                            726  ReviewNANA and in the South Atlantic region, particularly Maryland, Virginia, and North and South Carolina.9,73,74 Between 1873 and 1920, 431 cases of RMSF were described in the USA.75 Between 1997 and 2002, the average annual incidence of the disease was 2·2 cases per million people.9 Historically, approximately 250–1200 cases of RMSF have been reported annually in the USA, although it is likely that many more cases go unreported.76,77 Cyclic ﬂuctuations of the incidence of RMSF have been observed through the decades.78 Of note, the number of RMSF cases reported in the USA in 2004, 2005, and 2006 were 1713,79 1936,80 and 2092,81 respectively (each of these numbers represents the highest number of cases ever previously reported). The highest incidence has been observed in children aged less than 10 years (peak age-group, 5–9 years),74,78 and among adults aged 40–64 years.80 The incidence is also high among men and white people.82,83 Between 1983 and 1998, ﬁve to 39 deaths caused by RMSF were reported annually in the USA, and it has been estimated that some 400 additional deaths were not reported during the same period.84 In the past, the disease would kill up to 87% of those infected.12 Today, a fatal outcome has been reported in up to 20% of untreated cases and 5% of treated cases.9 Geographical variations in case fatality of RMSF are known to occur in the USA.75 Diﬀerent isolates of R rickettsii show diﬀerent levels of pathogenicity in endothelial cell culture;85 this might explain, in part, the variation in disease severity across distinct geographical regions. In other countries, the case fatality of RMSF can be even higher, as has been reported in Brazil (ﬁgure 5), where the average case fatality during 1995–2004 was 29·1%.86 Fatal outcome is associated with older patients (over 60 years), with a greater than 5-day interval between disease onset and treatment, with a lack of tetracycline treatment, or with chloramphenicol-only treatment.74,83,87 Fulminant RMSF in African-American men with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deﬁciency has been reported.88 In the USA, most cases of RMSF (90–93%) occur between April and September when the tick vectors are most active.17,83 RMSF cases are usually found in rural areas,4,17,89 although autochthonous cases have also been reported in urban settings,78 such as New York.90 Residence in wooded areas or in areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of R rickettsii infection.91–94 The disease is sporadic and is clustered in limited geographical regions. By contrast with what occurs in certain endemic areas (eg, Brazil), most cases of RMSF in the USA occur as widely spread single patients and the disease is seldom reported in clusters; only 4·4% of the cases are familial clusters.91Clinical manifestations Patients with RMSF display a diverse range of systemic, cutaneous, cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, Figure 4: Approximate geographical distribution of RMSF in the American continent Shaded areas show regions where RMSF is endemic.NA http://infection.thelancet.com Vol 7 November 2007substantial proportion of them need to be admitted to  hospital.83,93 The mean incubation period of RMSF is 7 days (range 2–14 days).17,30,32,34,74 Initial clinical signs and  symptoms are similar to those observed in other tickborne rickettsial diseases, making the clinical diagnosis diﬃcult       in this early phase when treatment would be most eﬀective.  of fever, headache, and rash is observed in only 3% of patients with RMSF.92 Initially, the disease is characterised by sudden onset of fever (usually greater than 38·9°C), signiﬁcant malaise, and severe headache (patients often describe the headache as the worst they have ever had),  usually accompanied by myalgia, anorexia, nausea,  vomiting, abdominal pain, and photophobia.5,9,83,92,95–97 During this phase, RMSF may be misdiagnosed as a viral illness.98  triad is seen in 60–70% of patients.11,99,100 A rash appears typically 2–5 days after onset of fever.17,32,34 First, the rash appears as small (1–5 mm diameter), blanching erythematous macules initially on the wrists (ﬁgure 6) and ankles, with subsequent centrifugal progression to the palms and soles. Then the rash spreads centripetally from the wrists and ankles to the arms (ﬁgure 7), leg, and trunk.12,98 By the end of the ﬁrst week, the eruption becomes maculopapular with central petechiae.92,101 The continuous skin and tissue damage caused by R rickettsii may result in skin necrosis and gangrene, requiring amputation in severe cases.11,102 However, 9–12% of patients do not break out in a rash.5,6,92,103,104 Lack of rash occurs most commonly in cases that are fatal, in older patients, and in African Americans.32,91 Other cutaneous manifestations include mucosal ulcers, postinﬂammatory hyperpigmentation, and jaundice.30,105 Unlike other tickborne rickettsial diseases, the presence of inoculation eschar is rare in RMSF.106  Pulmonary manifestations such as cough and pneumonia have been reported.92,108 Although hepatomegaly is noted at necropsy in almost all fatal cases, this ﬁnding is noticed in the physical examination of only 12–25% of patients.92 Acute renal failure is often observed in severe cases.92,109 Various neurological manifestations have been reported.3,30,110 Some 40% of patients may develop lethargy, photophobia, meningismus, amnesia, bizarre behaviour suggestive of psychiatric illness, or transient deafness.92,94,111 Ocular manifestations include conjunctivitis (30% of patients), optic disc oedema, arterial occlusion, retinal vein engorgement, retinal haemorrhage, and retinal sheathing.92,96,112,113 Cases of skeletal muscle involvement with high concentrations of creatine kinase have also been reported.114,115  Diagnosis: a dilemma for clinicians The diagnosis of RMSF is based on physical examination of the patient and epidemiological data.

Although this method has been used to diagnose non-fatal cases of RMSF, it seems to be more useful for detecting rickettsiae in necropsy tissues such as liver, spleen, lung, heart, kidney, and brain.9,126–130 Immunostaining for spotted-fever-group rickettsiae is oﬀered by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and certain US university-based hospitals and commercial laboratories.9 The use of PCR for the diagnosis of RMSF is limited because of its inferior sensitivity in detecting R rickettsii DNA in blood specimens.9,11,131–133 The number of rickettsiae circulating in the blood is typically low, particularly in the absence of advanced disease or fulminant infection.45 This technique seems to be more useful for the detection of R rickettsii in a skin biopsy or necropsy tissue specimen.55 In acute RMSF, laboratory conﬁrmation is improved when the PCR is used in association with immunohistochemical staining.9 New PCR-based methods (eg, quantitative PCR assay)134 have been developed for the detection and quantiﬁcation of R rickettsii, and other closely related spotted-fever-group rickettsiae, in diﬀerent types of samples. These techniques can oﬀer advantages in terms of speed, sensitivity, and reproducibility when compared with conventional PCR. Because R rickettsii is classiﬁed as a biosafety level-3 agent, laboratorial cultivation has not been routinely used for diagnostic purposes.9,11 Laboratory ﬁndings such as anaemia, thrombocytopenia, raised aminotransferase concentrations, increased bilirubin, increased creatine kinase, and hyponatraemia have been reported in RMSF.92,94,135 The diagnostic use of these ﬁndings is limited because they are unspeciﬁc. Diﬀerential diagnosis of RMSF includes an extensive list of tickborne and non-tickborne diseases (panel 2). be warranted during pregnancy.9 Treatment Because fatal cases of RMSF are often associated with delayed diagnosis, the decision to treat should never be delayed by laboratory conﬁrmation.9,17,30,34 Any patient with a fever and rash should be considered for hospital admission and antimicrobial therapy.136 Tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are the only drugs proven to be eﬀective for the treatment of RMSF.11 Because of its eﬀectiveness, broad margin of safety, and convenient dosing schedule, doxycycline is currently considered theNA http://infection.thelancet.com Vol 7 November 2007Prevention The development of vaccines against rickettsial diseases remains a low priority, as a result of the development of eﬀective and safe antibiotics, and mainly because of the decreased perceived threat posed by these diseases. Although some rickettsial pathogens (R rickettsii and R prowazekii) are considered by the CDC to be select agents, there are no vaccines for any rickettsial disease currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.146 Thus, it is essential to emphasise that avoidance of tick-infested habitats (eg, heavily wooded areas) is still the best way to prevent RMSF (panel 3).34,143,147  especially for people who live, work, or enjoy recreational activities in these environments.148 In these cases, individual protective measures must be adopted. People in contact with tick-infested habitats are advised to wear light-coloured, long-sleeved clothing and footwear, tuck trousers into socks, and bind the exposed edges. The use of permethrin on clothes as an acaricide may also be useful. Removal and decontamination of clothes immediately after leaving tick-infested areas is also suggested.9,34,147–149 Because the transmission of R rickettsii requires a minimum period of attachment,11,62,63 early tick removal is crucial to diminish the possibility of infection. Frequent physical examination to ﬁnd and remove attached ticks is recommended.9,78,144,150–152 This is particularly important when undergoing activities in tick-infested areas, particularly during tick season (eg, April to September in the USA), when risk of  tick exposure increases substantially. The basic recommendations for proper tick removal are shown in  panel 4.   http://infection.thelancet.com Vol 7 November 2007  ReviewNANA Panel 3: General recommendations for prevention of RMSF11,17,33,34 Data for this Review were identiﬁed by searching PubMed. • Avoid tick habitats, such as highly wooded areas, grassy edge of forests, stream banks, trails, and grassy ﬁelds • Adopt personal protective measures to limit the possibility of tick exposure • Frequently examine yourself to check for any attached ticks • Remove attached ticks properly to reduce the risk of R rickettsii transmission comprehensive overviews that are beyond the scope of the present article. Panel 4: Recommendations for proper tick removal11,17,34,153–155 • Wear protective gloves • Grasp the tick carefully with fine forceps, as close to the point of attachment as possible, and pull straight outward with gentle traction to remove the tick • Do not jerk, twist, squeeze, or burn the tick • Folk remedies (eg, petroleum jelly) should never be used • Disinfect the bite wound after tick removal in the skin has not been assessed fully,148 and the risk-to- beneﬁt ratio of the use of invasive procedures to remove ticks or their mouthparts is unknown. Chemoprophylaxis should be helpful in certain situations and consists of the use of the tick repellent DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) on the exposed skin.34 Prophylactic antibiotic administration after a tick bite is not indicated to prevent RMSF.11 Experimental animal models of R rickettsii infection have shown that the illness was not prevented, but only delayed.78Conclusions Over a century has elapsed since the ﬁrst clinical description of RMSF. Despite this, the disease remains among the most severe vector-borne diseases recognised Sometimes, it is not possible to avoid tick habitats, unknown. The diagnosis of RMSF remains a dilemma for clinicians because the diagnostic value of current tools is very limited, particularly during the early course of the illness. Better serological methods to detect speciﬁc antibodies to R rickettsii in the early phase of infection are needed. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the interaction between R rickettsii and the host immune system would help the development of an eﬀective vaccine against RMSF; however, many question whether it is really a priority to develop a vaccine for such sporadic (but persistent) and treatable disease. Given that RMSF is one of the oldest and most virulent vector-borne diseases known, which is still killing many of its victims, the answer should be “yes”.
